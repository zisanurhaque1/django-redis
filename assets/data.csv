instagram,"The #peaceful #propalestine #protest that was to be held in #Rome on Saturday 5 October escalated into clashes between some demonstrators and the police. The police made extensive use of tear gas and stun grenades, causing several injured and serious psycho-physical reactions among those present. Protesters threw glass bottles, road signs, pieces of soil and cherry bombs. 
The clashes lasted for about half an hour, the gathering in the square - which was at first forbidden and then authorised - lasted several hours, and after the violent escalation, a procession, unsupervised but permitted by the police, was set off in the Rome area of San Saba, and ended, peacefully and spontaneously, in front of Ostiense train station. 

The clashes are the outbreak of a pressing atmosphere of police control that began days before the protest and across the whole country. Police in all regions blocked cars and buses heading to Rome and patrolled trains in search of activists who, although unoffensive, were detained in the barracks. The Ostiense square was barricaded by police trucks and hundreds of riot police with batons in hand and shields raised. 
It is important not to forget that according to the law enforcement manuals and suggestion on crowd policing, precisely in order to avoid making the protesters feel threatened, the police should not wear helmets from the start, nor holding batons in their hands as if the unit is ready to charge. Furthermore, vehicles such as water cannons should not be used to threaten a non-threatening crowd, but only to intimidate where there is a tangible risk of clashes.

The real truth of life!

Rakesh Jhunjhunnwala's last words before he passed away with a net worth of 45000 crores:

I have reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. My life is an achievement in the eyes of others. However, I had no happiness except work. Money is just a truth I use.

Laying in a hospital bed at this point and looking back on my whole life, I realize that the identity and money I was proud of, faded and worthless before death.

You can hire someone to drive your car or earn money. But, you can't hire someone to suffer and die.

Lost physical items can be found. But there is one thing that is never found when lost - and that is ""Life"".

Whatever stage of life we are in, in time we will face the day when the heart stops.

Love your family, partner and friends...🙏treat them well, don't cheat them, never be dishonest or treacherous.

As we grow older and wiser, we slowly realize that wearing a watch costing Rs 300 or Rs 3000 or Rs 2- 4 lakh - all tells the same time.

Whether we have a wallet of 100 or 500 - everything inside is the same.

Whether we drive a car worth 5Lacks or a car worth 50Lacks. The path and the distance are the same and we reach the same destination.

Whether we live in a house of 300 square feet or 3000 square feet - loneliness is the same everywhere.

You will realize that your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world.

Whether you fly in first class or economy class, if the plane goes down, you are going to go down with it.

That's why.. I hope you realize, you have friends, brothers and sisters, with whom you chat, laugh, sing, share pleasantries,.... That's true happiness. !!

An indisputable fact of life:

Don't educate your children just to be rich. Teach them to be happy. When they grow up, they will know the value of things and not the cost.

At the All-Party Conference, President Asif Ali Zardari hit hard, calling on the international community to act now on the Palestinian crisis. 

He didn't hold back, condemning Israel for its ""genocide"" that has claimed over 41,000 Palestinian lives. Zardari called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Arab lands and urged the world to finally step up. 

Recalling his ties with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and meetings with Yasser Arafat, Zardari stressed Pakistan's unshakable support for Palestine. He also warned about Israel’s rising attacks, not just in Gaza but now spreading to Lebanon, Syria, and beyond—a direct threat to regional peace. Zardari’s message was clear: the world can't stay silent on this brutal escalation.

instagram,"Late Sunday, airstrikes targeted Beirut suburbs as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon amid a widening conflict with Iran-aligned militant groups. Palestinian officials reported that a strike on a mosque killed at least 19 people. A year after Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has exchanged fire with Israel since the Gaza war began.

instagram,"Ami Ajalons Worte spiegeln die tiefe Überzeugung wider, dass die Verantwortung füreinander im Judentum zentral ist – eine Verantwortung, die sich besonders in der Forderung nach der Befreiung der Geiseln zeigt.

Zum ersten Mal jährt sich heute der Überfall der radikal-islamistischen Hamas auf Israel am 7. Oktober 2023, bei dem mehr als 1.200 Menschen ermordet und etwa 240 Männer, Frauen und Kinder in den Gazastreifen verschleppt wurden. Noch immer werden 101 Geiseln von der Hamas gefangengehalten.

Auf die Frage, ob er an die Rückkehr der Geiseln glaubt, antwortet Ami Ajalon, ehemaliger israelischer Geheimdienstchef, in einem aktuellen Interview mit dem Tagesspiegel:

„Ich kämpfe dafür und spreche auf allen unseren Demonstrationen darüber. Die Befreiung der Geiseln ist unsere erste Pflicht. Doch die Regierung hat sie im Stich gelassen. Der Staat wurde geschaffen, um seine Bürger zu schützen. Wenn unsere Regierung sie nicht zurückbringt, dann verdient sie es nicht, an der Macht zu sein.“

Der Wunsch nach ihrer sicheren Rückkehr und einem Abkommen zur Geiselfreilassung bleibt laut.

The probe, led by FIFA's Disciplinary Committee, will examine claims that Israel's soccer body illegally incorporated teams from West Bank settlements into its leagues, violating international law. This decision marks a compromise, stopping short of suspending the Israeli soccer federation outright. FIFA President Gianni Infantino ensured due diligence and followed expert advice. The investigation's timeline remains undisclosed, but it addresses the long-standing concerns of the Palestinian soccer federation.

instagram,"On October 7, 2023, Israel faced an unexpected attack by Hamas, leading to immense loss of life and a breach of its defense systems. It has been a year of attack on Israel, the region is still mired in conflict. Missile launches and rising tensions in the Middle-East have worsened the humanitarian concerns in Gaza, leaving innumerable dead and displaced. The global powers remain divided on the conflict, with no peaceful resolution in sight yet.

Both Israel and India share a tragic bond as victims of terrorism from neighboring threats, standing united against this menace that endangers regional peace. India’s support for Israel is unwavering. While condemning the attacks, India continues to advocate for dialogue, peace, and justice, recognizing the humanitarian toll on civilians. Israel’s right to self-defense is recognized, and we stand in advocating peace during these challenging times. Both nations remain committed to defending their people from the constant threat of terror.

instagram,"7 اکتوبر 2023 کو شروع ہونے والی غزہ جنگ اب ایک سال تک جاری رہی ہے اور غزہ اور اسرائیل سے لبنان تک پھیل چکی ہے۔ اس جنگ کے نتیجے میں اسرائیل نے ایران، شام، عراق اور یمن پر حملے کیے ہیں اور فلسطینیوں پر بھی حملے کیے ہیں۔

جنگ اس وقت شروع ہوئی جب حماس نے اسرائیل پر ایک ہزار راکٹ فائر کیے اور مقبوضہ فلسطینی علاقوں میں اسرائیلی بستیوں اور فوجیوں پر حملہ کیا، جس میں ایک ہزار سے زیادہ اسرائیلی ہلاک ہوئے۔ سینکڑوں اسرائیلی شہریوں اور فوجیوں کو یرغمال بنا کر غزہ لایا گیا۔ اسرائیل نے اگلے دن غزہ کے شہریوں پر اپنی بدترین فضائی بمباری کے ساتھ ساتھ زمینی کارروائی کا جواب دیا جو آج تک جاری ہے۔ گزشتہ ایک سال کے دوران اسرائیلی حملوں میں تقریباً 42 ہزار فلسطینی شہید ہو چکے ہیں جن میں 16 ہزار بچے اور 11 ہزار خواتین شامل ہیں جب کہ ایک لاکھ سے زائد فلسطینی زخمی ہو چکے ہیں۔

اقوام متحدہ اور عالمی طاقتوں کی طرف سے جنگ بندی کی کوششیں اور ناکامی ہوئی ہے لیکن سب بے سود رہی۔ نومبر 2023 میں جنگ کے آغاز کے ایک ماہ بعد، دونوں فریقوں نے بین الاقوامی ثالثوں کی موجودگی میں 4 روزہ جنگ بندی پر اتفاق کیا، جس کے دوران دونوں فریقوں نے قیدیوں کا تبادلہ کیا۔ بعد ازاں امریکی صدر جو بائیڈن اور دیگر ممالک نے جنگ بندی کے لیے کئی کوششیں کیں لیکن مستقل جنگ بندی نہ ہونے کے باعث معاہدہ نہ ہو سکا۔

امریکہ نے گزشتہ سال اکتوبر سے اسرائیل کو 17 بلین ڈالر کی فوجی امداد دی ہے جو اسرائیلی دفاعی نظام کو فعال رکھنے، بحری جہازوں کے لیے تیل خریدنے اور دیگر ہتھیاروں کے لیے استعمال کی گئی۔ مزید برآں، امریکہ ایران کو انٹیلی جنس معلومات فراہم کرتا رہا ہے تاکہ حزب اللہ اور ایران کے حملوں کو روکا جا سکے۔

غزہ جنگ کے نتیجے میں کئی سینئر کمانڈروں کی ہلاکت، ہزاروں لبنانی شہریوں اور لاکھوں بے گھر ہوئے ہیں۔ اسرائیل ایران پر حماس اور حزب اللہ کی حمایت کا الزام لگاتا ہے اور اپریل میں اسرائیل نے شام کے شہر دمشق میں ایرانی قونصل خانے کی عمارت پر فضائی حملہ کیا تھا جس کے نتیجے میں سات اہلکار مارے گئے تھے۔

جنگ کے ایک سال بعد، غزہ میں 20 لاکھ فلسطینی اب بھی بے گھر ہیں، جب کہ شمالی اسرائیل میں رہنے والے تقریباً 20 لاکھ اسرائیلی یا تو بے گھر ہیں یا نظر بند ہیں۔ ہزاروں ٹن بم گرانے اور ہزاروں فوجیوں کے ساتھ زمینی آپریشن کرنے کے باوجود اسرائیل غزہ سے حماس کا صفایا نہیں کر سکا اور آج بھی غزہ میں مزاحمت کا سامنا ہے۔

PM slams global silence

Marking one year since the latest Israeli aggression, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif voiced strong condemnation of the global inaction on the ongoing violence in Palestine. 

With 41,000 Palestinian lives lost, the PM stressed that Israel’s actions mock international laws and urged the world to break its silence. 

Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support, he called for urgent global intervention to halt Israel’s atrocities.

Putin justified sending troops to Ukraine to protect Russian speakers against a “neo-Nazi dictatorship”. He criticized “Western elites” for turning Ukraine into a military base aimed at Russia. Putin stated that the conflict in Ukraine is about securing a prosperous future for future generations.

3. Focus on strategy.

A good strategy will help to use expensive resources such as: People, money, technology ... economically and effectively.

A good strategy is like a flat road. If you have it, you have almost 50% chance of winning a race.

From the beginning, Ukraine had 2 extremely good strategies: Aid from the US, the West and the support of international law when Russia was the one who initiated the conflict.

Russia is on a rocky road, although it is a large country, it will also face many disadvantages if the conflict is prolonged.

In movies, a good soldier can dodge an incoming artillery shell. But in the actual recorded video. There is no chance of survival in such a situation. Therefore, the best way to master the battlefield is to calculate every step of the soldier in advance.

To be more specific, without a good strategy and plan, rushing into battle is like throwing yourself into a giant meat grinder. It is a meaningless sacrifice.

That makes having a good strategy even more important. If the president has a good strategy, the Department of Defense will have a good plan, the troops will have good steps.

There are principles to remember:

- The value of the head of the agency lies in the vision. To create good strategies, plans, and steps.

-The value of those who execute strategies and plans lies in their knowledge, skills, experience and absolute loyalty...

Never doubt this, because when a boat is drifting on a dark sea, the one who can help it escape is the one with the compass, not the best rower.

Russia, President Putin, and the Russian Ministry of Defense must find truly influential ""compasses"". Ignoring all principles, ranks, ages... As long as someone says they are confident that they can do well, why not let them try, in important moments, this will be the fastest, most direct way to find talent for the country.

Finally, from faraway Vietnam, I would like to send my best wishes to Russia to always be strong to overcome all obstacles.

instagram,"💥⚠️Putin decided to send a nuclear message to Washington in response to what he views as reckless aggression from the U.S. and its allies, particularly in the context of their growing involvement in the conflict with Russia. 

The decision is tied to updating Russia’s nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons to include cases where Russia's sovereignty is critically threatened, rather than just its existence as a state.

instagram,"THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT COULD END SOONER IF RUSSIA DID THESE 3 THINGS. (EPISODE 1/2)

1. Reconsider the ""shortcomings"" in the special military operation in Ukraine.

The Russian government should review all activities related to the special operation in Ukraine from the beginning.

For example, the allocation of finances, personnel positions, or the effectiveness of combat plans... The Wagner mercenary force is also an activity with many ""unknowns"".

Reviewing and handling the ""shortcomings"" that can affect the combat effectiveness of the Russian army will reaffirm the prestige of the Russian government, build trust, and fill the army with more fighting enthusiasm.

2. Always be fair to the soldiers.

Modern soldiers, what do they fight for? For the duty of a soldier? Or for the glory of the motherland?... All of these are correct, but...

A country of more than 140 million people. But only 500,000 people are actually sacrificing for the benefit of the country, while the remaining 140 million people are safe and working for their own benefit.

Looking back at history, soldiers used to consider sacrificing for the country as glorious, because in their society at that time, almost no one worked for personal benefit.

Whether on the front line or inside the country. All soldiers and civilians are contributing to the ideal of the motherland with everything they have. It is very fair, no one has to regret.

But today is different. Because we are living in a capitalist era. When the war is over, soldiers will have to face the pressure of life like ordinary people. That is why developed countries always pay appropriately for each soldier who goes to war.

In short, regardless of the era, social justice is the key to creating strength. Russian soldiers must have it.

instagram,"🇺🇸🇺🇦Donald Trump said the war in Ukraine would be “resolved very quickly” if he won the US election as he met Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday (September 27), and touted his “very good relationship” with both the Ukrainian leader and Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. 

The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy had been in question throughout the week, with the former US president criticising the Ukrainian president for “refusing” to make a deal with Putin and members of the Republican party accusing him of siding with Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. 

While the meeting was a sign that they are searching for a common understanding of how relations between Washington and Kyiv might change in a second Trump presidency, the former president renewed his push for peace talks with Russia.

Ukrainian and many western officials have rejected the proposal as premature, saying negotiations would cement Russia’s control of big chunks of the country’s territory. 

“We have a very good relationship,” Trump told Zelenskyy as they jointly spoke to reporters before their meeting. “I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin . . . if we win I think we’re going to get it resolved very quickly.”

In a sign of the testiness around the gathering, Zelenskyy quickly interjected to say he hoped Trump would have “more good” relations with him compared with Putin. Trump responded: “You know, it takes two to tango.” 

In a brief interview with Fox News after the meeting, Trump repeated that he would broker a “fair and rapid deal” to end the war. “It has to be fair,” he said. He also called the conflict “a very complicated puzzle”.

instagram,"NUCLEAR WARNING

On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia could use nuclear weapons if hit with conventional missiles and that it would consider any assault on it aided by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. 

Putin said, “In the updated version of the document [Russia’s nuclear doctrine], aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state but with the support of a nuclear state is proposed to be considered as their joint attack on Russia. Russia will also consider the possibility of using nuclear weapons when receiving reliable information about a massive launch of means of aerospace attack and their crossing of our state border. This includes strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles and drones, hypersonic and other delivery vehicles. Russia preserves the right to use nuclear weapons in case of aggression, including if the enemy using conventional weapons poses a critical threat.”

Putin made these remarks while opening a meeting of Russia’s Security Council. The decision to change Russia’s official nuclear doctrine is Moscow’s answer to discussions in the West about whether or not to allow Ukraine to use conventional Western missiles against Russia. 

Russia’s existing nuclear doctrine set in 2020 allows Russia to use nuclear weapons in case of a nuclear attack by an enemy or a conventional attack that threatens the existence of the state.

instagram,"📌 The Ukrainian military used a US-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) to strike a Russian radar station, targeting the Nebo-M radar system. This strike aimed to reduce Moscow’s ability to detect and intercept aerodynamic and ballistic targets. Russia is believed to have only 10 operational Nebo-M radar systems remaining, each costing over $100 million. The Nebo-M is considered a sophisticated radar system that can detect targets at a distance of 1,000 kilometers.

instagram,"रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष, जो 2014 में शुरू हुआ था, यूक्रेन के पश्चिमी समर्थक राजनीतिक बदलाव के बाद रूस द्वारा क्रीमिया पर कब्ज़ा करने के बाद बढ़ गया। अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समुदाय द्वारा व्यापक रूप से निंदा किए जाने के बाद, रूस समर्थित अलगाववादियों ने पूर्वी यूक्रेन के कुछ हिस्सों पर कब्ज़ा कर लिया, जिससे डोनबास क्षेत्र में युद्ध छिड़ गया।

फरवरी 2022 में, रूस ने यूक्रेन पर पूर्ण पैमाने पर आक्रमण किया, जो एक महत्वपूर्ण वृद्धि को दर्शाता है। रूस ने सुरक्षा चिंताओं और नाटो के पूर्व की ओर विस्तार को औचित्य के रूप में उद्धृत किया, जबकि यूक्रेन और उसके सहयोगियों ने इसे संप्रभुता पर एक अकारण हमला माना।

संघर्ष ने व्यापक तबाही, मानवीय संकट और वैश्विक आर्थिक व्यवधानों को जन्म दिया है। दोनों पक्षों को भारी नुकसान के बावजूद, यूक्रेन ने कुछ क्षेत्रों को पुनः प्राप्त करते हुए मजबूत प्रतिरोध किया है। पश्चिमी देशों, विशेष रूप से नाटो सदस्यों ने रूस के खिलाफ सैन्य सहायता और प्रतिबंधों के साथ यूक्रेन का समर्थन किया है।

2024 तक, संघर्ष जारी है, कूटनीतिक प्रयास स्थायी युद्धविराम बनाने में विफल रहे हैं, जिससे क्षेत्र अनिश्चितता की स्थिति में है।

instagram,"The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in 2014, escalated after Russia annexed Crimea, following Ukraine’s pro-Western political shift. The annexation, widely condemned by the international community, was followed by Russian-backed separatists seizing parts of eastern Ukraine, sparking a war in the Donbas region.

In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a significant escalation. Russia cited security concerns and NATO’s eastward expansion as justification, while Ukraine and its allies saw it as an unprovoked attack on sovereignty.

The conflict has led to widespread devastation, a humanitarian crisis, and global economic disruptions. Despite heavy losses on both sides, Ukraine has mounted strong resistance, reclaiming some territories. Western countries, particularly NATO members, have supported Ukraine with military aid and sanctions against Russia.

As of 2024, the conflict remains ongoing, with diplomatic efforts failing to produce a lasting ceasefire, leaving the region in a state of uncertainty.

1. More than 24 million Yemenis, including 12 million children, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, facing severe food insecurity and malnutrition, with over 2.3 million children under the age of five suffering from acute malnutrition.

2. The conflict has led to the displacement of over 4 million people within Yemen, while nearly 300,000 Yemenis have sought refuge in neighboring countries, compounding the humanitarian crisis.

3. Access to healthcare has been severely disrupted, with over 20.5 million Yemenis lacking adequate access to healthcare services, leaving children particularly vulnerable to deadly diseases such as cholera, malaria, and diphtheria.

4. Approximately 3.7 million Yemeni children are out of school due to the conflict, with over 2,500 schools damaged or destroyed, denying children their right to education and leaving them more susceptible to exploitation and recruitment by armed groups.

instagram,"**Yemen Civil War (2015-present)**

The Yemen Civil War, which began in 2015, has evolved into one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of the 21st century. This conflict erupted when Houthi rebels, an armed group from the Zaidi Shia minority, seized control of Yemen's capital, Sana'a, and eventually forced President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi into exile. The situation quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war involving multiple factions and international powers.

A key component of the conflict has been the intervention of a Saudi-led coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates and several other Arab states. This coalition has been fighting against the Houthis in support of the internationally recognized Yemeni government. The coalition's intervention has included airstrikes, blockades, and ground operations, aimed at restoring Hadi's government and curbing the influence of Iranian-backed Houthis.

The humanitarian impact of the war has been profound. Yemen has faced severe food shortages, widespread disease outbreaks, and the destruction of infrastructure, leading to what the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Millions of Yemenis have been displaced, and the country has struggled to cope with the scale of suffering.

Efforts to broker peace and reach a resolution have been ongoing, with various international organizations and mediators working to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table. Despite these efforts, a lasting solution remains elusive, and the conflict continues to cause immense hardship for the Yemeni people.

The Yemen Civil War highlights the complex interplay of local, regional, and international factors in modern conflicts, and underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive and humanitarian-focused approach to resolving such crises.

instagram,"🕌 De acordo com a imprensa internacional, os Houthis do Iêmen continuam a atacar navios ocidentais que passam pelo Mar Vermelho apesar de todas as garantias de retaliação do Ocidente.

Os Houthis são militantes fundamentalistas do Iêmen que, pelo menos desde 2014, estão em confronto aberto contra as forças do governo do país e contra tropas sauditas - importantes aliados do Iêmen. 

Recebem apoio, financiamento e treinamento do Irã e cumprem o papel de verdadeiro proxy no embate que existe entre iranianos e sauditas pela hegemonia do Oriente Médio, quase como uma verdadeira Guerra Fria.

Graças aos ataques Houthis no Mar Vermelho, países ocidentais decretaram um ultimato ao grupo para que todo e qualquer ato ofensivo nestes mares cessasse, algo que não foi e, ao que parece, nem será correspondido pelo grupo islâmico. 

Nesta quinta-feira, dia 4, um barco não tripulado Houthi se aproximou a poucas milhas de distância dos navios da marinha americana, segundo a imprensa global, o que pode ser entendido como uma verdadeira provocação e isso pode representar o escalar dos conflitos no Oriente Médio.

instagram,"Amal Hussain (7) 

{2011- October 26th, 2018} 

Amal died from severe malnutrition three years after her family escaped their home due to Saudi air strikes.

Amal had become a symbol of the civil war and subsequent famine when her photo, which was taken at a UNICEF clinic, was broadcast around the world, and just a week later she died from starvation and malnutrition at a refugee camp. At the UNICEF-run hospital Amal was vomiting and suffered from diarrhoea while doctors gave her milk every two hours.  Her mother was also reportedly ill with dengue fever spread by mosquitoes in the camp’s stagnant water. 

Due to the ongoing war approximately 7 million children are facing famine due to a severe lack of food and resources, and approximately 1.8 million under the age of five were facing acute malnutrition, with 400,000 currently suffering from acute malnutrition as of 2018. 

Since 2016, a food insecurity crisis has been ongoing in Yemen which began during the Yemeni Civil War. The UN estimates that the war has caused an estimated 130,000 deaths from indirect causes which include lack of food, health services, and infrastructure as of December 2020.

In 2018, Save the Children estimated that 85,000 children have died due to famine in the three years prior. In May 2020, UNICEF described Yemen as “the largest humanitarian crisis in the world”, and estimated that 80% of the population, over 24 million people, were in need of humanitarian assistance. In September 2022, the World Food Programme estimated that 17.4 million Yemenis struggled with food insecurity, and projected that number would increase to 19 million by the end of the year, describing this level of hunger as “unprecedented.” The crisis is being compounded by an outbreak of cholera, which resulted in over 3000 deaths between 2015 and mid 2017.

instagram,"Civil wars are intricate conflicts stemming from a myriad of factors, and while national politicians can influence their trajectory, attributing them solely to political failure oversimplifies the issue. Historical, social, and economic dynamics often contribute significantly. Ethnic and cultural divides, exemplified by the Hutu-Tutsi tensions in the Rwandan Civil War, showcase how deep-seated divisions can erupt into conflict. The economic dimension is evident in disparities like those in Sudan, where resource distribution played a role in the North-South conflict. Historical grievances, as seen in the Balkans, where unresolved tensions from previous conflicts fueled the breakup of Yugoslavia, emphasize the lasting impact of history on civil unrest. Weak institutions, exemplified by corruption and instability in countries like Somalia, contribute to an environment conducive to conflict. Political instability, demonstrated by the frequent changes in leadership in Afghanistan, has hindered the establishment of a stable government. However, attributing civil wars solely to national politicians neglects the broader context. The Lebanese Civil War, for instance, involved regional and international actors contributing to the complexity. Addressing civil wars requires recognizing and addressing these multifaceted issues. It involves not only the actions of national politicians but also the engagement of international actors, local communities, civil society, and regional organizations in a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention and resolution. The responsibility extends beyond individual politicians to encompass the collective efforts of diverse stakeholders in fostering lasting peace.

instagram,"Pemerintah Britania Raya mengumumkan bahwa mereka telah memberikan dana sebesar $205 Juta USD untuk menunjang keberlangsungan kemanusiaan di Yaman pada Jumat, (28/7). 

Berdasarkan laporan dari Kantor Luar Negeri Inggris, sana tersebut diberikan dalam rangka menunjang kebutuhan primer di Yaman seperti alat-alat kesehatan, bahan pangan, dan perairan. 

Selain itu, melalui unggahannya di Twitter resmi, Kementerian Luar Negeri Inggris mengonfirmasi telah meluncurkan program kemanusiaan baru dalam rangka memberikan dukungan kesehatan yang krusial bagi perempuan dan anak-anak Yaman. 

""Program empat tahun £ 160 juta ($205 Juta USD) akan memberikan perawatan kesehatan primer, termasuk nutrisi, kebersihan air dan sanitasi serta layanan kesehatan seksual dan reproduksi untuk beberapa yang paling rentan di Yaman,"" ucap pihak Kementerian Luar Negeri Inggris. 

Diadakannya program tersebut juga bertujuan untuk mengurangi potensi kematian dan penyakit yang terjadi pada perempuan dan anak-anak. 

Menteri Luar Negeri James mengatakan,"" Konflik di Yaman terus menyebabkan rasa sakit dan penderitaan bagi jutaan orang Yaman, dengan wanita dan anak-anak khususnya membayar harga yang mahal (kesehatan),"" ucapnya. 

""Inggris tetap berkomitmen untuk mengatasi krisis kemanusiaan di Yaman, dan program wanita dan anak-anak Yaman yang baru akan memberikan dukungan penting kepada yang paling rentan,"" lanjut James Cleverly.

Sebagai informasi, Yaman telah dideklarasikan sebagai 'failed state' atau negara yang gagal dalam menjaga kesejahteraan masyarakatnya. Hal tersebut dikarenakan negara tersebut telah menjadi korban perang antara pasukan pemerintah dan kelompok Houthi (kelompok Islam Syiah yang memihak pada Iran) selama sembilan tahun. 

Perang tersebut telah menempatkan negara itu pada krisis kemanusiaan dan menyebabkan ekonomi negara kehilangan $126 M USD. 

Perang sipil yang terjadi di Yaman juga telah menyebabkan masyarakatnya bergantung pada bantuan internasional.

Last night (Thursday) the IDF attacked a house with terrorists in Tulkarm with a fighter jet. According to Palestinian reports, 18 people were killed in the attack. The IDF and the Shin Bet updated that they killed the head of the Hamas terrorist infrastructure in Tulkarm, Zahi Yasser Abd. Alrazak Ofi, and other terrorists by his side.

The IDF was preparing to commemorate the anniversary of the Otef massacre, and the possibility that Hamas would try to carry out terrorist attacks. According to the IDF, Ofi was a “ticking bomb” and towards October 7th he was planning to carry out a large and significant attack.

According to the IDF’s announcement, Ofi planned and led the attempted car bomb attack in Atret in September. “As part of his duties, he provided weapons to many terrorist operatives in the area and planned to carry out many more significant attacks on settlements in Iosh and the Israeli rear,” it was noted. “He took part in the planning and execution of a number of significant and powerful attacks against civilians in the territories of Judea and Samaria, including attacks in which Israeli civilians were injured. In this framework, he worked to establish terrorist infrastructures on behalf of Hamas and helped terrorist operatives in the region carry out significant shooting and incendiary attacks.” Rith Radwan, the commander of the terrorist organization in the Tulkarm refugee camp, was also killed in the attack.

This is the first attack carried out in Tulkarm using a fighter plane since the second intifada. So far, in the few times they attacked in Judea and Samaria, fighter jets bombed only in Jenin and Nablus.

instagram,"”Israel-Palestina på svensk tv 1958–1989” låter som titeln på en svensk C-uppsats. Egentligen borde den heta ”Så framställdes Israel och Palestinakonflikten på Sveriges television mellan 1959–1989”. Å andra sidan säger det kanske sig självt, det fanns bara public service mellan dessa årtal. Och SVT rapporterade duktigt nerifrån Mellanöstern. 

Ska man säga något om dokumentärerna är att den ger en fördjupad bild av både Israel och Palestinas historia. Här får man så att säga veta varför det blev som det blev, från ax till limpa. Historien berättas genom en mängd inslag och reportage som kort presenteras av med årtal, namn och reporter av Fatima Varhos. Kanske att man önskar att dokumentärserien skulle lånat lite från serien” Världens konflikter” (2008-) där en speaker fyllde i vissa skeenden. För man låter verkligen materialet tala för sig själv på alla de sätt och har man ingen förförståelse blir det svårare att hänga med. 

Man menar också att arkivmaterial säger ganska lite av vad som verkligen skett men mycket om hur det framställdes. Ett ganska märkligt påstående, materialet visar väl vad som hände? Hur det framställdes finns det säkerligen forskning om bland mediestudier, om man vill djupdyka. Däremot kan det tänkas att regissören Göran Hugo Olsson själv gjort ett urval där han berättar en version av många. Och det sägs egentligen ingenting om hur SVT framställde konflikten. Det blir en linjär berättelse som berättar om de stora händelserna, kriget, folkets lidande på båda sidor, hopp om fred och så vidare.

 Men ”Israel-Palestina på svensk tv 1958–1989” är ändock brännande aktuell och visar verkligen på hur komplex denna konflikt är.

Madu merupakan salah satu cairan alamiah yang dihasilkan oleh lebah dari nektar bunga, dengan rasa manis serta banyak manfaat yang selama ini dikenal oleh masyarakat dunia. Seperti dicatat dalam berbagai teks agama, naskah kuno, bahkan ukiran dari zaman batu, madu telah dianggap sebagai obat ajaib sepanjang sejarah. 

Dilansir dari Republika, madu telah menjadi bagian dari banyak peradaban di dunia. Termasuk dari bangsa Sumeria ke kerajaan Yunani, Romawi dan Tiongkok, di mana mitos tentang ramuan madu yang memberikan keabadian terlahir.

Tapi tahukah kalian dimana lebah yang menghasilkan madu terbaik di dunia? Lebah ini ada di Timur Tengah, tepatnya Yaman. Madu kan dihasilkan lebah dari nektar tanaman, sedangkan Yaman dan Timur Tengah pada umumnya gersang dan minim tanaman. Bagaimana lebah yaman bisa menghasilkan madu terbaik di habitatnya yang seperti itu?

instagram,"RIUNIFICAZIONE DELLO YEMEN

Il 22 maggio 1990 le due repubbliche yemenite, la Repubblica Araba dello Yemen (Yemen del Nord), di matrice repubblicano-autoritario, e la Repubblica Democratica dello Yemen (Yemen del Sud), ideologicamente marxista/arabo socialista, si unirono per formare la Repubblica dello Yemen.

Dopo anni di scontri e lunghi negoziati, i due governi raggiunsero un accordo per unire il Paese sotto un'unica amministrazione: Ali Abdullah Saleh venne nominato Capo di Stato e Ali Salim al-Beidh divenne Capo del Governo. L’unificazione venne confermata da un referendum nel 1991.

La riunificazione dello Yemen ha rappresentato un momento di grande speranza e ottimismo per il popolo yemenita, oltre che per la pace nella regione. Si sperava infatti che la fusione delle due repubbliche potesse portare a un periodo di stabilità politica, sviluppo economico e progresso sociale per tutto il paese.

Tuttavia, la riunificazione non è stata priva di sfide e difficoltà. Le differenze politiche, economiche e culturali tra il Nord e il Sud hanno creato tensioni e divisioni. Inoltre, le disparità socio-economiche e le questioni territoriali hanno contribuito ad alimentare il malcontento e le tensioni interne.

Nel corso degli anni successivi alla riunificazione, lo Yemen ha affrontato una serie di problemi, come corruzione, instabilità politica e insicurezza economica. Già nel 1993 scoppiò una prima guerra civile, quando i sudisti del Partito Socialista Yemenita secederono per dare vita alla Repubblica Democratica dello Yemen - di nuovo. 

A questa situazione continua di scontro si aggiunsero le mire autoritarie di Saleh e la conseguente guerra civile del 2014: lo scoppio del conflitto tra il governo yemenita e i ribelli Houthi ha ulteriormente complicato la situazione nel Paese, portando a una guerra civile che ha causato una grave crisi umanitaria.

La situazione in Yemen rimane tuttora complessa e instabile, con conseguenze devastanti per la popolazione. La guerra ha causato un'enorme sofferenza umana, con milioni di persone che sono state costrette a lasciare le proprie case, affrontando la fame, la malnutrizione e la mancanza di assistenza medica adeguata.",30.0,1.0,,yemencivilwar,Oriente Moderno,2023-05-22T12:47:26.000Z
instagram,"The Israeli army acknowledged yesterday that Iran's Tuesday night missile attack on the occupied state damaged some of its air bases, but it said the damage was minimal.

According to the military, as was cited by Army Radio, the strikes only caused damage to office buildings and other maintenance facilities on the sites, not harming the Israeli Air Force's ability to carry out its duties. They did not target aircraft, weaponry, or critical operational equipment.

""All of the missile impacts in the air bases are deemed by the military as 'ineffective,' meaning that no harm was caused to the continuous operations of the air force,"" the army stated in a statement. ""No air force aircraft were damaged in the attack.""

 उसे संयुक्त राष्ट्र के इतिहास पर एक दाग के रूप में याद किया जाएगा। इजराइल अपने नागरिकों की रक्षा करना और अपनी राष्ट्रीय गरिमा को बनाए रखना जारी रखेगा, चाहे एंटोनियो गुटेरेस हों या न हों।""

However, there is yet to be any specific plan to include the troubled South Arabian nation within bilateral peace negotiations.

The Iran-Saudi reconciliation seems to be making progress since it was first announced. Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, released a press statement on Monday announcing that embassies will reopen in both Tehran and Riyadh by May 10, six years after they were closed.

Abdollahian tweeted, “I received congratulation calls from the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, as well as the foreign ministers of Iraq and Oman, on the agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to normalize ties.”

The Houthis have a complex relationship with Yemen's Sunni Muslims; the movement has discriminated against Sunnis, but also recruited and allied with them.Under the leadership of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, the group emerged as an opposition to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. They accused him of corruption and criticized him for being backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States. Hussein accused Saleh of seeking to please the U.S. at the expense of the Yemeni people and Yemen's sovereignty.

Resisting Saleh's order for his arrest, Hussein was killed in Sa'dah in 2004 along with a number of his guards by the Yemeni army, sparking the Houthi insurgency in Yemen

People's Democratic Republic of Yemen
جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية

Independence declared : 30 November 1967
UN membership : 14 December 1967
Constitution adopted : 31 October 1978
Unification : 22 May 1990

Government : Unitary Marxist–Leninist
one-party socialist republic

South Yemen's origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British Colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate, which consisted of two-thirds of the present-day Yemen. Prior to 1937 what was to become the Colony of Aden had been governed as a part of British India, originally as the Aden Settlement subordinate to the Bombay Presidency and then as a Chief Commissioner's province. After the collapse of Aden Protectorate, a state of emergency was declared in 1963, when the National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) rebelled against the British rule.

The Federation of South Arabia and the Protectorate of South Arabia merged to become the People's Republic of Yemen on 30 November 1967, which later changed its name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. It became a Marxist–Leninist one-party state in 1969 and was supported by Cuba, East Germany and the Soviet Union. It was the only communist state to be established in the Arab world

Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region, it was involved in a brief civil war in 1986. Following the collapse of the USSR, South Yemen was unified with the Yemen Arab Republic, commonly known as ""North Yemen"", on 22 May 1990 to form the present-day Republic of Yemen. After three years, however, a political crisis arose between the South's YSP and the North's GPC and Islah parties after the parliamentary elections in 1993. South Yemen declared its secession from the North Yemen in 1994 as the Democratic Republic of Yemen. This effort ended after North Yemen occupied the area as a result of the 1994 civil war. Another attempt to restore South Yemen as a nation, with the Southern Transitional Council as its new government, began in 2017 as part of the 2014 Yemeni Civil War.",21.0,1.0,,yemencivilwar,𝟏𝟗𝟏𝟎𝐬 ~ 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟎𝐬,2022-11-05T21:07:23.000Z

Date : 16 September 2014 (Begin)

The Casualities of War

💀 377,000+ people killed overall (150,000+ from violence) (2014–2021) (UN)

💀 85,000 Yemeni children died from starvation (2015–2018) (Save the Children)

💀 ~4,000 dead from cholera epidemic; 2.5+ million cases overall (2016–2021)

💀 4 million people cumulatively displaced (2015–2020) (UNHCR)

💀500+ killed in Saudi Arabia by Houthi attacks (2014–2016) (Saudi Arabia figure)

🇦🇪 3 Emirati civilians killed

CNN reported on 8 April 2015 that almost 10,160,000 Yemenis were deprived of water, food, and electricity as a result of the conflict. The report also added per source from UNICEF officials in Yemen that within 15 days, some 100,000 people across the country were dislocated, while Oxfam said that more than 10 million Yemenis did not have enough food to eat, in addition to 850,000 half-starved children. Over 13 million civilians were without access to clean water

💀 War crime accusations

According to Farea Al-Muslim, direct war crimes have been committed during the conflict; for example, an IDP camp was hit by a Saudi airstrike, while Houthis have sometimes prevented aid workers from giving aid.

The UN and several major human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may have been committed by Saudi Arabia during the air campaign

British researcher Alex de Waal wrote that the ""responsibility for Yemen goes beyond Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to London and Washington. Britain has sold at least £4.5 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and £500 million to the UAE since the war began. The US role is even bigger: Trump authorized arms sales to the Saudis worth $110 billion last May. Yemen will be the defining famine crime of this generation, perhaps this century.""

Watch the incredible 18-minute video of a Ukrainian drone operator sparing the life of a wounded Russian soldier in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region ¹.

The drone footage, set to an ominous tune, shows the soldier surviving two attempts on his life before the operator decides to help him to safety.

A Stunning Turn of Events

After dropping five lethal grenades, the drone controller returns to find the Russian soldier begging for his life.

The Ukrainian operator takes pity on the injured soldier, dropping off water and instructions to reach Ukrainian lines.

A Perilous Journey

The Russian soldier, exhausted and battered, makes his way through No Man's Land, guided by the Ukrainian drone.

He even takes a cigarette break before continuing, lying in a crater for a few minutes.

A Remarkable Act of Humanity

The Ukrainian drone leads the soldier to safety, where he's met by two infantrymen who march him to their command post.

This remarkable footage is believed to be part of the K-2 Battalion's recruitment efforts [1).

instagram,"During the discussions, EU sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan emphasized the need for relentless enforcement of the price cap, which currently prevents access to Western shipping services for Russian oil sold above $60 per barrel. However, the measure's impact has diminished as Russia has built up a fleet of aging tankers to bypass sanctions, raising concerns about safety and environmental risks. The EU Commission highlighted that Russia is spending nearly half of its federal budget on defense and security, with increased costs for crucial imports like semiconductors and machine tools, largely sourced through Turkey and China. O'Sullivan noted the EU's plans to target specific financial institutions and scrutinize product transit from Southeast Asia through China that supports Russia’s military efforts. Ukraine’s presidential adviser flagged China as a key issue, reflecting growing international concerns about Beijing’s role in the conflict. The meeting underscored the importance of coordinated action and stricter enforcement to close loopholes and apply pressure on Moscow.

When will Nato stop provoking Russia?

According to Russia's assessment. Will Nato's actions in Ukraine lead to a direct confrontation with Russia? Nato itself is a group of European military powers, they have enough capacity to calculate all the consequences when that happens.

The reason they continue to provoke Russia is because they know the “limit” of their military strength, they know that Russia's military capacity without using nuclear weapons cannot defeat Nato.

There will be no other way. To end all threats from the West. Russia will have to push its military capacity to be on par with Nato. Let's leave nuclear weapons out of the race. Russia's strength exists within itself. That strength once helped the Soviet Union defeat Nazi Germany.

Russia is aiming to return to the world's leading position as the Soviet Union once was. Therefore, a future military capacity equal to, or greater than, Nato is necessary.

instagram,"There is considerable acrimony and ire in Russia over Indian-origin artillery ammunition being used in Ukraine. Photographs of both Indian-origin and Pakistani-origin artillery/mortar ammunition have been appearing on social media over the past several months. Moscow has reportedly raised this issue at least on two occasions, including in July 2024 during a meeting between the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. This indicates a diplomatic strain as Russia seeks to address its concerns regarding the supply of Indian-made 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine.

Now ‘Reuters’ has published a report, citing two Indian government and two India’s defence industry sources (all unnamed), saying that India produced only a very small amount of the ammunition being used by Ukraine; one official estimating that it was under 1% of the total arms imported by Kyiv since the war. Adding spice to the narrative, Walter Ladwig of King’s College London, said the diversion of a relatively small amount of ammunition was geopolitically useful for Delhi since it allows India to show partners in the West that it is not ‘on Russia’s side’ in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.”

Calling the Reuters report “inaccurate, misleading, speculative and mischievous”, Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, has said, “It implies violations by India where none exist and, hence, is inaccurate and mischievous.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict will end in negotiations. But those negotiations will only happen if one of the two sides loses on the battlefield.

If the US changes its stance towards Russia. The most they can do is return to a state of political neutrality but still sell weapons to Kiev.

The world may change. But Russia will end the conflict with Ukraine by completely overwhelming them on the battlefield.

La città sta affrontando una crescita senza precedenti, fino al 2015 era una piccola città di quasi 400.000 abitanti, controllata da tribù locali. Oggi conta quasi 3 milioni di abitanti, attrae investimenti da tutto il paese e resta l'unico luogo dello Yemen dove c'è libertà di espressione, grazie ad una politica aperta del governatore Sultan al Arada. 
Marib era un tempo la capitale dell'antico regno della Regina di Saba, le cui rovine ancora vengono visitate dalle famiglie locali. Le recenti situazioni politiche dello Yemen stanno portando Marib a diventare una delle città più sviluppate del paese.
Le famiglie approfittano del cessate il fuoco tra le forze Houthi e quelle della coalizione per tornare ad affollare i luoghi di aggregazione. 
Nonostante la linea del fronte a pochi kilometri dal centro cittadino, Marib cerca di tornare a vivere.

instagram,"May Allah save Yemen!

#Yemen, a country that is heavily ignored when it comes to war, mass hunger and massacres, is a live example where all wrongs are ignored for the sake of interests. A country where two sides have been fighting for rule constantly, one being backed by #Iran and the other by #SaudiArabia, #UAE, #Sudan and #US and to challenge the Iranian ""supremacy"" in it's neighboring country, is conducting a live example of massacres that are being ignored. While the world is severely disturb by what is happening in #Ukraine, they overlook heavily of what is happening in Yemen because the influential countries are themselves involved over here. 

Yemen is a battle ground between Houthis in the west and the ""government"" in the east. Houthis have taken control of the western and more populated area while the ""government"" resides in the east. There is a mass starvation in western area specifically, with children dying as a result of hunger more than the war. There are absolutely no food supplies to the western side as the Saudi Arabia overturns them to the port of Jizan, there is no oil and gas over there that is sent through the #UN, while the infrastructure has taken the form of rubble and dust. In this side taking war of so called ""Sunni-ism vs Shia-ism"", which is actually the war to control the oil facilities in the Yemen; the ones who are being ignored the most are the civilians.

The ones who can stop the war have the blood of innocent civilians on thier own hands. The lust for wealth has killed 233,000 ,in which 131,000 have died as a result of hunger, lack of medical supplies and so on. It's also the live example of how Islam is being used as a political weapon to destroy the lives, rather than to save the lives. 

May Allah Almighty save Yemeni people from this war which has destroyed the lives of themselves and thier loved ones. Ameen.

instagram,"Yemen's Forgotten War

On this day in 2014, Houthi rebel forces expanded their territorial control in Yemen, sparking the official start of the Civil War in 2015.

Catalina Martin-Chico is one of the few photographers who has worked in Yemen on a regular basis during the last decade. Her 2016 collection of photographs focuses on the effects of conflict on local inhabitants.

Despite the present ceasefire, the conflict shows no prospects of conclusion after 8 years.

Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world, and the civil war has gone virtually unnoticed by the major Western press, despite the horrific conditions in which the Yemeni people live.

For much of the war, the country has been divided between the Houthis and their allies, based in the North, and the internationally recognised government in Aden, supported by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Sudan, Morocco and Senegal. 

Saudi Arabia alleges that the Houthis are receiving arms and training from it's arch rival Iran, a fact that has widened the conflict significantly and tied it into the broader regional conflict that is playing out from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq and other parts of the gulf. 

Since the beginning of 2015, Saudi and allied planes have been bombarding strategic targets to deprive the Houthis of infrastructure to continue the war. As so often in modern warfare, however, it's the civilian population that bears the brunt of the suffering.

Supply routes and agricultural output have entirely broken down as a result of the war. Famine has been ravaging the country's population since 2016, compounding the already terrible effects of the Civil War. An estimated 24 million people (80% of the population) require humanitarian assistance. In addition to soaring food prices, 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes.

The Sainte Therese Hospital's administration announced the ""suspension of hospital services"" due to ""severe damage"" to the structure and equipment as a result of nighttime raids that caused significant damage in the surrounding area. The hospital is located in the Hadath neighborhood in the southern suburb.

Because all routes and supply lines have been shut off and staff access to the hospital is restricted, the administration of the Meiss Ej Jabal Hospital in southern Lebanon announced the hospital's evacuation as well as the ""suspension of work in all its departments.""

According to Stephen O’Brien, the United Nations humanitarian affairs coordinator, the level of disregard for human life and the resulting suffering in that country is nearly incomprehensible. Furthermore, parties involved in the conflict are accused of violating both international human rights law and international humanitarian law to the extent that it should “shock the conscience of humanity”. 

Since the start of the war in Yemen in 2015, 111 000 people have lost their lives, and since the beginning of 2022 one person has died or has been injured every hour. These figures are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. Moreover, thousands of airstrikes have resulted in the breakdown of medical and educational facilities, while food insecurity — which worsened as a result of the #ukrainian invasion — has affected more than 16.2 million people in Yemen, with in excess of 2.25 million children suffering from acute malnutrition. Furthermore, outbreaks of cholera and Covid-19 have worsened conditions for civilians who have already lost their access to the basic human rights of education, food, personal security and healthcare. 

This post is made to show how russian invasion shows up in media and how US invasions cannot get any media to come in public, the situation is worst in countries like Yemen, #somalia #afghanistan🇦🇫 but these white #european motherfuckers concern for other white men being dying in war torn areas of Ukraine.

instagram,"US Discusses Joint Response After Iran Launches Missile Barrage at Israel

The United States announced that it is in discussions over a coordinated response after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel, warning Tehran of ""severe consequences"" for the attack. Israel, while intercepting most of the missiles, vowed to make Iran ""pay"" and threatened immediate, powerful retaliation across the Middle East.

The missile strikes, which occurred late Tuesday, have further escalated tensions in the already volatile region. Tehran, in a show of defiance, warned that it would target critical infrastructure across Israel if Iran's territory were attacked in response.

President Joe Biden expressed the United States' unwavering support for Israel following the missile assault. He emphasized that discussions are ongoing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to determine a joint response to Iran’s aggressive actions.

When pressed by reporters about potential US actions towards Iran, Biden stated, ""That's in active discussion right now,"" signaling that a formal response could be imminent.

The escalating rhetoric and military actions have raised concerns about further conflict in the Middle East, as both nations stand firm in their retaliatory threats.

While Israel intercepted many missiles, some struck central and southern areas, resulting in injuries. This attack comes in response to Israeli operations against key figures in Hezbollah and Hamas, intensifying the already volatile Israel-Palestine conflict. The international community is urged to act decisively to prevent further violence and promote peace in this troubled region.

instagram,"As it began conducting ground operations in Lebanon on Tuesday, Malaysia ""unequivocally"" denounced the ""Zionist"" Israeli regime, according to Anadolu Agency.

The Foreign Ministry released a statement saying, ""The Zionist Israel regime's actions clearly violate security, stability as well as the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, contravening the United Nations Charter and international law.""

Early on Tuesday, the Israeli army declared that it had begun ""limited and targeted"" ground operations in the southern region of Lebanon.

The question ""Is Lebanon part of Israel's promised territory?"" was released on September 25 in tandem with Israel's ground invasion and attack on the country. Critics have interpreted the date and content of the article as proof of Israel's regional expansionist intentions.

instagram,"The Iran-Israel conflict is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been ongoing for decades. At its core, it's a proxy conflict between Iran and Israel, with Iran supporting Lebanese Shia militias, such as Hezbollah, and Palestinian groups like Hamas, while Israel supports Iranian rebels and conducts airstrikes against Iranian allies in Syria.

*Historical Context*

The conflict has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, when Iranian Islamists, including Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani and Ruhollah Khomeini, began sympathizing with the Palestinian people and criticizing Israel's existence. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran's new government adopted a policy of hostility towards Israel, severing diplomatic ties and referring to Israel as the ""Zionist regime"".

*Key Issues*

Several factors contribute to the ongoing tensions:

- Palestinian Support: Iran sees itself as a champion of the Palestinian people, while Israel views Iran's involvement as an existential threat ¹.
- Nuclear Program: Israel is concerned about Iran's nuclear ambitions, and has conducted airstrikes and assassinations to hinder its progress ¹.
- Regional Influence: Iran seeks to expand its influence in the Middle East, while Israel aims to limit its reach ¹.

*Recent Developments*

The conflict has escalated in recent years, with increased military clashes and proxy wars in Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. The 2024 Iran-Israel conflict has seen significant exchanges of fire, including Iranian strikes against Israel and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets.

*International Response*

The international community has called for restraint and diplomacy, with some countries, like Russia, attempting to broker peace talks. However, a lasting resolution remains elusive, and the conflict continues to simmer.

The package, expected to include artillery, air defenses, and critical munitions, underscores the US commitment to supporting Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. Despite inventory shortages, the US is adapting its approach, announcing larger aid packages for longer-term delivery. This move aligns with estimates that Ukraine requires at least $500 million in monthly assistance through 2025.

instagram,"🇪🇺🇺🇦The European Union pledged on Friday (September 20) to lend Ukraine up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) as part of a loan package organized by the Group of Seven major industrial nations, as it seeks to help the country rebuild its economy and its war-shattered power grid.

G7 leaders agreed in June to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral, but progress in distributing the loans has been slow.

“We should make Russia pay for the destruction it caused,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters at a news conference in Kyiv with President Vlodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv.

Von der Leyen said that the EU has already provided Ukraine with more than 118 billion euros ($132 billion) in military and economic assistance since the war began in February 2022, “but Russia’s relentless attacks mean further support is necessary.”

The loans would be underwritten by the windfall profits earned on almost $300 billion in Russian assets, which have been frozen over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The vast majority of that money is held in EU nations, notably Belgium.

Von der Leyen said that the EU is “confident that we can deliver this loan to Ukraine very quickly.” The 27-nation bloc hopes that other G7 countries will follow its lead and start providing loans too.

Zelenskyy said that his priorities are to rebuild Ukraine’s energy network, erect more bomb shelters, improve schools and buy more weapons and ammunition.

Jaishankar, who arrived here from Saudi Arabia after attending the first India-Gulf Cooperation Council Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue, said they also exchanged views on Ukraine, Gaza and the Indo-Pacific region.

External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar shared that he had an exchange of views on several global issues, including the situations in Ukraine, Gaza, and the Indo-Pacific region. He also expressed his anticipation of welcoming German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock to India for the 7th Intergovernmental Consultations.

In a press statement alongside Baerbock, Jaishankar stated, ""We had a productive discussion on the state of the world, covering a wide range of topics. Our conversation included Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in Gaza and its wider implications, and other developments in West Asia and the Middle East.""

He further mentioned that they focused on the Indo-Pacific region and briefly discussed events occurring in their respective neighborhoods. ""Our engagement in defense and security has seen significant growth, including the first-ever air exercises this year. We look forward to welcoming German naval ships to Goa next month. Our policy dialogues and exchanges have been mutually beneficial, and we are eager to explore closer cooperation between our defense industries,"" Jaishankar added.

Jaishankar highlighted India's plans to establish 12 new industrial zones across the country, presenting new opportunities for collaboration with Germany. He noted, ""Currently, our trade stands at approximately $30 billion annually, with German investments in India around $25 million, and slightly lower investments from our side. However, there remains vast untapped potential for growth.""

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Tuesday (September 10) said that the Russia-Ukraine conflict cannot be resolved on the battlefield.

He added that Russia and Ukraine will have to negotiate and in case they want advice, India is always willing to give, reported

Jaishankar made the remarks while responding to questions at the Annual Ambassadors’ Conference of the German Foreign Office in Berlin.

A day before, he had held a conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the India-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) foreign ministers’ meeting in the Saudi capital.

“We don’t think this conflict is going to be resolved on the battlefield. At some stage, there’s going to be some negotiation. When there is a negotiation, the main parties – Russia and Ukraine – have to be at that negotiation. If you want advice, we are always willing to give it,” said Jaishankar, reported.

Jaishankar also said that India has not closed business with China and admitted that no country in the world can refuse doing business with the country..

Those who are also pejoratively called the Akhdam (servants) represent between 5 and 12% of the Yemeni population.

instagram,"On the global stage, the response to traditional and emerging challenges like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics reveals significant gaps. The World Health Organization’s limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow progress in climate action highlight the shortcomings of existing global institutions. The threat of nuclear proliferation, while less widespread than feared, remains significant, with countries like North Korea and Iran pursuing nuclear capabilities.

Domestically, the United States faces internal divisions and deteriorating social cohesion, impacting its global influence. Political polarization, rising violence, and economic mismanagement have eroded confidence in U.S. stability and effectiveness. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and inconsistent foreign policy approaches have further undermined America's position.

In response to these challenges, the United States should prioritize strengthening alliances and partnerships to deter aggression from Russia and China. It must balance immediate support for Ukraine with realistic strategies for resolving the conflict and consider economic distancing from China to reduce dependency. Strategic clarity on Taiwan and building resilient supply chains are crucial for managing relations with China.

Overall, U.S. foreign policy should be pragmatic, focusing on maintaining international order through alliances and selective partnerships rather than attempting to transform rival powers. Realism should guide diplomacy, emphasizing achievable goals and practical solutions over idealistic ambitions. Addressing these challenges requires increased defense spending, cautious yet bold economic policies, and a strategic approach to global issues.

instagram,"The geopolitical landscape is increasingly complex and fraught with challenges. As the conflict in Ukraine reveals, Russia, despite its military aggression, is emerging as a weakened power. The sanctions imposed by Western nations, coupled with a failing economy and poorly organized armed forces, diminish Russia’s threat compared to the Cold War era. However, its significant military and nuclear capabilities, combined with Vladimir Putin’s willingness to act recklessly, still make it a formidable danger in the near term.

China presents a more substantial long-term challenge. The hope that integrating China into the global economy would lead to political openness and moderation has not materialized. Instead, China has grown more repressive domestically and aggressive internationally. Its military and economic might have increased, and its actions in the South China Sea, its treatment of Taiwan, and its influence over global supply chains reflect a serious challenge to the international order. China’s internal weaknesses, such as economic stagnation, political constraints, and demographic issues, complicate the situation. Moreover, the potential for a difficult leadership transition adds further uncertainty.

The alignment of Russian and Chinese interests against a U.S.-led international system complicates U.S. foreign policy. Both nations share a common hostility toward the existing global order, increasing their collaboration and challenging U.S. leadership. Cont'd....... #talkdiplomacy #Geopolitics

The Biden administration on Wednesday issued sanctions targeting an international business network that funds Yemen’s Houthi rebels and their attacks on civilians in Yemen and the Persian Gulf, an action that is part of efforts to bankrupt funds that prolong the country’s seven-year civil war. 

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the sanctions were closely coordinated with Gulf partners as a response to Houthi attacks inside Yemen and recent terrorist attacks targeting civilian sites in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over recent weeks, which have caused numerous civilian casualties.

Israel claims that Hezbollah weaponry was the focus of Monday's strikes. It was Lebanon's bloodiest day since the end of the 1975–1990 Civil War, according to the Health Ministry, with over 550 persons killed in the attacks, including at least 50 children and 98 women.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday demanded an immediate end to the ongoing Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip, terming it “systematic slaughter” and “bloodshed”. 

The premier was addressing the plenary meeting for the UN General Debate as the second speaker at the 79th session of the 193-member United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.

He said humanity was diminished when the “endless suffering” of Palestinians was ignored. It is not enough to condemn … we must act now and demand an immediate end to this bloodshed.

He said the world must work for a durable peace for Palestine through a two-state solution. PM Shehbaz demanded that Palestine be immediately admitted as a full UN member.

PM Shehbaz said it was a matter of “great honour” for him to address the UNGA for the second time as the prime minister of Pakistan.

instagram,"An airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen’s Houthi rebels killed at least 70 people and injured over 130 in the city of Saada on Friday. ⁠
⁠
Another strike reportedly hit a telecommunications building in the city of Hodeidah, knocking out internet access throughout the country. The airstrikes were the latest escalation in Yemen’s civil war as it continued into its eighth year and extended the country’s humanitarian crisis. On Monday, Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone attack that killed three oil workers — two Indians and one Pakistani — in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. The drone attack prompted Emirati officials to formally ask the U.S. to reinstate the Houthis as a terrorist organization. When a reporter at President Joe Biden’s Wednesday press conference asked if he was considering this, Biden said, “It’s under consideration. And ending the war in Yemen takes the two parties to be involved to do it.  And it’s going to be very difficult.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken previously removed the Houthis from the terrorist list in February 2021. ⁠
⁠
Coverage was more common on the left than on the right. Some outlets on the left published explainers on the situation after the Abu Dhabi attack. ⁠

instagram,"Global peace and prosperity require an efficient, rules-based system, according to the head of EU foreign policy, which was stated on Wednesday at the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York, according to the Anadolu Agency.

Josep Borrell questioned how nations can claim to be devoted to the UN Charter while many UN resolutions in the Middle East remain unmet for an extended period of time during a G20 conference of foreign ministers on UN reform.

He stated that only when the UN Charter's ideals are upheld and enforced when necessary can the UN and states' commitment to it be seen as trustworthy, pointing out that Israel has disregarded UN resolutions and decisions made by international courts.

""Mike Tyson 78 milyon dolarlık ünvan maçının hastalığı yüzünden 4 ay ertelenmesi sebebi ile CNBC'de canlı yayına katıldı. Söyleşinin bitiminde aynen şunları söyledi.
""Son olarak canlı yayını bahane bilerek bir kaç şey söylemek istiyorum. Biliyorsunuz aylardır Filistin topraklarında işgalci faşist İsrail rejimi tarafından bir soykırım gerçekleştiriliyor, dünyanın gözü önünde onbinlerce çocuk kadın masum insan hayatlarını kaybetti ve kaybediyor, buradan faşist barbar İsrail rejimine karşı direniş gösteren dünya halklarına bir şey söylemek istiyorum. Bir boksör ringe çıktığında dakikalarca dövüşür yumruk yer ve yumruk atar bazen bu o kadar uzar ki 11. rounda kadar yılmadan yumruk sallarsınız seyredenler bu yumrukların bir işe yaramadığını zanneder. Çünkü rakip hala ayaktadır ve sürekli yıkılmadığı ve güçlü olduğu izlenimi vermeye çalışır ama boksörler bilir ki aslı öyle değildir. 11 round boyunca atılan o yumruklar aslında o son yıkıcı vuruşa hizmet eder ve zamanı geldiğinde o son asil yumruk karşınızdakini yere devirir. İsrail'e karşı verdiğimiz direnişin işe yaramadığına bizi inandırmaya çalışanlara aldırmayın.

İsrail in ne kadar güçlü yıkılması imkansız bir rakip olduğunu göstermek isteyen şeytana inanmayın. Attığımız her yumruk onu yere yıkacağımız son yumruğa hizmet ediyor. Yılmadan yıkılmadan direneceğiz, boykota devam ediyoruz, direnişimizi sürdürüyoruz, bu direnişe katılan her renkten her ırktan her dinden insana saygı duyuyorum lütfen yılmayın son yumruğu düşünün hiçbir kötülük sizden güçlü değildir...""

Mike Tyson bu konuşmayı 4 kez sözünü kesmek istemelerine rağmen yapıp bitirdi konuşmayı geçen hafta yapmış.""

Among children, acute malnutrition has dramatically increased, and an increase in humanitarian aid is critical. The United States has responded to the call for aid with $165 million, aimed at supporting the World Food Program’s efforts to deliver food. Other states, especially those which also have bloody hands from supplying the conflict with weapons, must follow the Biden administration in support of ending the devastating war and aiding the millions of innocent victims of this humanitarian catastrophe. ⁠

The coalition managed to retake the city after 6 months of bloody fights in the streets and pushed the Houthi back to the north. 
Aden is now controlled by STC, a secessionist movement backed by the UAE (for its own commercial interests) with the aim of bringing back national borders as they were before 1990: two different countries, North and South Yemen.
Aden was once a cosmopolitan and buzzing city, now it is a poor city that carries with it the signs of war everywhere.

instagram,"@sociolegalcorp Human rights lawyers representing hundreds of victims of Yemen’s civil war are calling on the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition during the devastating conflict.

British lawyer Toby Cadman filed the request Monday, highlighting three separate incidents – an August 2018 airstrike that destroyed a school bus and killed dozens; a missile attack in October 2016 that killed at least 110 people; and allegations of torture and murder of civilians being held in prisons in the south of Yemen.

The filing came a day after a missile and drone attack, blamed on the Houthi rebels, on a key military base in Yemen’s south killed at least 30 troops.

The civil war in Yemen erupted in 2014, when the Iranian-backed Houthis swept across much of the north and seized the capital, Sanaa, forcing the internationally recognized government into exile. The Saudi-led coalition entered the war the following year on the side of the government. All sides are accused of atrocities in the yearslong conflict.

Lawyer Almudena Bernabeu, representing victims of the school bus attack, said that the coalition said it would investigate the deadly strike and bring those responsible to justice.

“Of course, they did no such thing,” Bernabeu said in a statement. “As the court of last resort, victims and families have no choice but to call on the International Criminal Court to ensure justice is done.”

A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.

Yemen is not a member state of the court and nor are key coalition members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 

However, in a 212-page written submission, the lawyers argue that the court should exercise jurisdiction because some members of the coalition are ICC member states.

“Speed &  Surprise  is  the  essence  of  any  combat”
~StuG. 

[ A Ratel ICV ( Infantry Combat Vechile ) in its top speed during combat manuvers ] 
.
.
Named after the Honey-badger, the Ratel ICV is a a long-running family of 6x6 armored vehicles which has been developed & produced in South Africa. After using tracked armored vechiles for several years, they realized that wheeled AFV’s were more mobile, more reliable & more ideally suited for dashing across the sandy, grassy & bushy parts of the country. It also meant the vehicles could drive to their target areas, rather than being delivered by transporters or railway like the tracked vehicles. 

The South Africans have since become something of experts in the field of wheeled armored vehicles, “primarily where land mines are a concern”. The production of Ratel commenced in 1978 & final deliveries were made during 1987. All models of the Ratel have a 6x6 drive configuration with the long armored steel hull being specially contoured underneath to minimize land mine damage, & if necessary it can also travel with two wheels missing. 

It has a turbocharged diesel engine which produces 282 hp & provided the vehicle with a road speed of 105 km/h on ideal surfaces and up to 30 km/h on uneven terrain at an perational range of 997 km. Tests have also proven that it is also amphibious.

Ratel was designed for speed & mobility, thus it had to sacrifice its armor. It has an effective thickness of 20 mm over the frontal arc. The upper hull sides are 8 mm, lower hull 10 mm, rear hull 10 mm & floor hull 8 mm. It’s mine resistance is derived from the hull`s height above the ground, which is due to its large oversized wheels. The original production version was the Ratel 20 which featured a 20mm cannon. The Ratel 60 had a 60mm mortar, the similar Ratel 80 made use of an 81mm mortar. The Ratel 90 included a 90mm cannon as well as interior room for up to 6 troops. There were also other variants such as Command vechiles, ATGM & logistics carrier etc.

The Palimob, whether Western, Asian, African or Middle Eastern, are in no rush to #decolonise #australia #americas #canada #newzealand #commonwealth #africa, every Middle Eastern country outside the Arabian Peninsula (because that is the only land that Arabs actually come from - everyone in the Middle East and North Africa before the #arabconquests and #arabslavetrade was actually part of the same Neolithic Fertile Crescent population) #taiwan #tibet #korea and yet, in their selective outrage, have the mental space and identity insecurity to screech about decolonisation ""by any means necessary"". Begs the question: If you believe in decolonisation by any means, why are you upset about the Nakba (that Arab leaders, not Israel, caused when they declared war and told Arabs to get out)? Sounds a lot like projecting our ancestors' sins onto Jews again. Our favourite ploy, historically.

The Canaanites became the Israelites. Jews are the inheritors of Canaanite religious traditions, culture, language AND genes. The Kingdom of Israel was established around 1048 BCE. It later became Israel and Judah. It was stolen by colonisers and even with the Diaspora, Jews retained their connection to the land. Zionism began with the Babylonian enslavement of the Israelites, not Herzl. Palestine is a colonial entity which should be fucking obvious given Arabic has no 'P' and Syria-Palaestina is clearly a Latin name. The Philistines weren't even from the Arabian Peninsula, you wilfully ignorant, morally bankrupt fools, they were Minoans from Crete! 

You use Palestinism to create a sense of righteous, shared identity because you're ashamed of your real one and so you don't actually have to fight for reform or put effort into being responsible - to the Palimob, Palestinians are just chess pieces in this privileged persons' game. They are the 'noble savage' for you patronising shits. If you really cared, you wouldn't repeat #fromtherivertothesea knowing it's an impossible death cult, you'd push a #democratictwostatesolution.

instagram,"As the 79th session of the UN General Assembly continues, the U.S. government is watching to see how other nations' votes align or do not align with their own. But is the prevalence of Israel-Palestine votes at the UNGA making the U.S. appear more isolated than it actually is?

UC Santa Barbara's Bridget Coggins, Julia Morse, JungJae Hong, and Annjulie Vester look at voting data to find that by overweighting issues of contention that draw UNGA roll-call votes, the U.S. government is overlooking areas of broad consensus.

instagram,"I attended a talk on ""Historical Origins of the #Palestine War"" this evening at the India International Center, presented by Prof. Madavan Palat, former Chairman of the Centre for Historical Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, editor of Selected Words of Jawaharlal Nehru, and trustee of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund. I must say this was the best lecture about the historical perspective of the crisis I have come across in recent years.

In an extensive one-hour lecture, Prof. Palat, in the presence of former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon and Mr. C. Aday Bhaskar, explained the reasons behind the brutality of Israel against the Gazans as well as the people of Lebanon. He also stated that, in reality, it's the Arabs who should have been involved in this crisis more than Iran, but the monarchs and kings there are not accountable to their public.

When I asked why the Arabs are not as involved as Iran, not even 20 percent of the same, he said that it is due to the fear of revolution. He explained that they know public anger against Israel on the Arab streets can anytime turn toward Arab rulers, and they won't be able to save themselves from the ire.

I must say people like Mr Palat keep on reviving our diminishing hope in humanity through their ways of speaking out against the brutality of the state and society. #IsraelPalestineConflict #GazaGenocide‌ #IsraelLebanonConflict",8.0,0.0,,israelpalestineconflict,Syed Hassan Kazim,2024-09-24T19:13:04.000Z

White House National Security Advisor John Kirby explained that the ATACMS is ineffective against Russian warplanes used for long-range strikes in Ukraine, as they are stationed deep within enemy territory beyond the weapon’s reach, which has a maximum of 300 kilometers. Kirby stated that 90% of the aircraft are outside this range, inside Russia.

instagram,"Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed willingness to resume peace talks with Ukraine, despite previously stating that Ukrainian military actions in Kursk made negotiations impossible. He referenced a peace deal that was initially outlined during earlier discussions in Istanbul, suggesting that it could serve as a foundation for a new agreement. Putin emphasized that Russia has never refused negotiations, but any dialogue should be based on the existing framework from the Istanbul talks rather than new or vague demands.

Putin also suggested that BRICS member nations, specifically China, Brazil, and India, could potentially act as mediators in future negotiations. As the current chair of BRICS, which includes South Africa as well, Russia seeks to involve these emerging economies in the peace process to help facilitate discussions and potentially reach a resolution.

So what
It seems possible that Putin may be willing to negotiate, but it is unlikely that much of his positions will change. In particular, Ukraine has continued to state that they want Russia to withdraw outside of the pre2014 borders, something Russia is highly unlikely to do. In an additional statement today, Putin stated that Russia's primary goal in Ukraine is to control the Donbas region, indicating they are highly unlikely to give it up in any peace negotiation.

Volgens het agentschap zouden 60% van deze slachtoffers omkomen door de indirecte gevolgen van de oorlog zoals extreme honger of gebrek aan toegang tot gezondheidszorg. 

Er woedt al zeven jaar een bloedige burgeroorlog in Jemen die ondertussen al honderdduizenden mensenlevens heeft geëist. In 2014 namen de sjiitische Houthi-rebellen de hoofdstad Sanaa in na een militaire coup. In maart 2015 schoot buurland Saudi-Arabië de verdreven soennitische Jemenitische regering te hulp met een militaire interventie. Sindsdien zijn de regeringstroepen, gesteund door een internationale coalitie onder leiding van de Saudi’s, en de Houthi’s, gesteund door Iran, verwikkeld in een hevige strijd. Volgens de VN is dit aanhoudende conflict uitgemond in ‘de ergste humanitaire crisis ter wereld’.

instagram,"""रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष: कालक्रम और संभावित समाधान""
 रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष, जो 2014 में शुरू हुआ, फरवरी 2022 में तेज हो गया जब रूस ने यूक्रेन पर पूर्ण पैमाने पर आक्रमण शुरू किया। संघर्ष की जड़ें सोवियत संघ के पतन से जुड़ी हैं, जहां यूक्रेन पश्चिम के साथ घनिष्ठ संबंध बनाना चाहता था, जबकि रूस का लक्ष्य अपने पूर्व क्षेत्रों पर प्रभाव बनाए रखना था। जब रूस ने क्रीमिया पर कब्ज़ा कर लिया और पूर्वी यूक्रेन में अलगाववादी आंदोलनों का समर्थन किया तो तनाव बढ़ गया। कालानुक्रमिक रूप से, युद्ध में कई युद्धविराम और शांति वार्ता विफल हो गईं, जिससे व्यापक तबाही, बड़े पैमाने पर विस्थापन और वैश्विक आर्थिक व्यवधान, विशेष रूप से ऊर्जा और खाद्य आपूर्ति में व्यवधान हुआ। इस संघर्ष ने अंतरराष्ट्रीय अभिनेताओं को आकर्षित किया है, जिसमें नाटो और यूरोपीय संघ यूक्रेन का समर्थन कर रहे हैं, जबकि रूस को प्रतिबंधों का सामना करना पड़ रहा है। एक संभावित समाधान बातचीत के जरिये समाधान में निहित है जो रूस की सुरक्षा चिंताओं को संबोधित करते हुए यूक्रेन की संप्रभुता का सम्मान करता है। कूटनीतिक प्रयास, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय मध्यस्थता और बातचीत के माध्यम से विश्वास का पुनर्निर्माण युद्धविराम का मार्ग प्रशस्त कर सकता है, जिससे अंततः युद्ध कम हो सकता है।

instagram,"Our new article ""Theses on Capitalism and the Generalisation of War"" has now been published on our website! 

""As war rages around the world, it is the working class who invariably pay the price, without so much as a choice in the matter of their own lives. Against the chorus of bourgeois political actors, and even so-called “socialists” and “anarchists”, who exhort us to line up behind one camp of imperialist murderers or another, we reject their paradigm altogether, and instead insist on the need for the working class to develop and maintain its political independence with respect to capital and its institutions; to refuse to allow itself to be used as cannon fodder by any of the warring sides and organise itself to achieve their mutual overthrow.

The defence of proletarian internationalism—the core communist principle that workers’ interests are the same everywhere and that, contrarily, they have no interest in common with “their” exploiting class—and its practical application: revolutionary defeatism, is fundamental today for communists who wish to act to stem the bloody tide of capitalist civilisation.""

Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world and the devastating civil war has continued to affect the most vulnerable. 

Did you know that the famine in Yemen has been ongoing since 2016?! Every day thousands of Yemeni children die from hunger or disease. Malnutrition rates among women and children are the highest in the world. 

📌Important Stats:
~16.2 million people are food insecure 
~24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020

Saudi Arabia’s blockade tactics in Yemen have prevented food and aid to reach the civilian population. The US needs to stop supporting the Saudi-led coalition’s offensive operation in the war. 

This has gone far too long.

When such awful events happen in different countries it's natural that some will get more attention than others. Let's not forget Yemen this week, they need our help and our donations are so precious to them. 

Thank you to everyone who has been sharing and caring with what's been going on, especially in Palestine. May Allah grant the Palestinians ease, peace and justice. Right now they need our voices more than ever, our spreading of awareness and protest! 

If you can, head over to the link in my bio and remember the people of Yemen today. Even if it's just £1/$1. Every little makes a difference inshaAllah.

Seeing the flags in their headgear and how they were just packed with stuff I immediately knew I needed a picture of them. After having taken the picture the rest of the team and I went into the restaurant we were having lunch at and thought nothing more of the guys outside. 
Coming back outside after our lunch I was met by a group of soldiers and the officer in charge asked me in a harsh tone asked what the hell I was doing in their district and why I was taking pictures of people. Luckily my fixer quickly got there and sorted out the situation. But I still love this little colorful and cheerful moment in the middle of the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

~John Steinbeck

Sanighdha writes:
“It is in common parlance that the war going on in Yemen has been and is still inflicting huge losses on the nation as a whole- including its people, its limited natural resources coupled with the loss of property and impairment of foreign relations with almost all the worldly nations. While the conflict has its root in the Arab Spring when stability of most of the Arab nations was questioned by their own citizens, the war in Yemen has acquired several other political, economic and social dimensions; not to mention the chaos that the world powers have created in Yemen for furthering their own interests. However, it is pertinent to note that the Yemen Civil war must end, for conflicts lead to more conflicts and not to solutions.”

Through this article, the author tries to bring the inevitability of a ceasefire in the Yemen civil war, to the notice of the readers.

⁠
⚖️ Sanctions and frosty trade relations have been a consistent theme of international trade in the past half-decade, but even more so after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.⁠
⁠
🚫 Since then, Western governments have attempted to curtail direct and indirect trade with Russia, both to impose economic punishment and diminish Russia’s ability to produce military equipment.⁠
⁠
🌎 However, the world of international trade is often quite opaque, and while governments can introduce sanctions, their effectiveness is not guaranteed.⁠
⁠
✍ In our latest #TRADEFINANCETALKS Magazine Issue 22, Trade Finance Global’s Deepesh Patel spoke with Ravi Amin, CTFC, Trade Compliance Subject Matter Expert, at S&P Global Market Intelligence to discuss S&P Global Market Intelligence’s whitepaper, “Are transshipment hubs facilitating the movement of Western-made components to Russia?”⁠

The rifle also has a modified magazine well in order to accept STANAG magazines.

It is unknown how this rifle ended up in Yemen although is it is thought that China may have sold some rifles to the Government prior to the civil war, or perhaps these rifles came from Sudan where the rifle is made at the Military Industry Corporation from components shipped from China.

instagram,"Ukraine has urged Mongolia to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin during his upcoming visit on September 3, in compliance with an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant issued last year for war crimes related to the deportation of Ukrainian children. The Kremlin, however, expressed confidence that Mongolia, an ICC member since 2000, would not take such action. This visit marks Putin's first trip to an ICC member state since the warrant was issued, and according to ICC rules, Mongolia is obligated to arrest and transfer him to The Hague.

instagram,"Very nice image depicting a Houthi fighter in Yemen armed with a very nice example of a Dragunov SVU rifle that is essentially a bullpup version of the SVD. Yemen received a batch of these rifles from Russia prior to the ousting of the Saleh government in February 2012. Additionally, a fighter next to him can also be seen armed with an AK-104 which is essentially a shortened version of the AK-103. The AK-104 is actually rather common in Yemen as Russia delivered quite a few of them to different units of the Yemeni army prior to the outbreak of the civil war.

instagram,"Yemeni Houthi fighters can be seen here armed with either an American M47 Dragon ATGM supplied to the Saudi’s or an Iranian reverse engineered copy of the American M47 known as the “Saeghe”. The United States military officially resigned this weapon in 2001 and destroyed its remaining stocks in September 2009, but the Saudis do still operate this platform, albeit in small quantities. In my opinion it is much more likely for these to be Iranian copies due to the large amounts of munitions that the IRGC supplies to the houthi movement. The Saeghe 1 was first shown by the Iranians in 2001 and is thought to have entered serial production in 2002. Iran later introduced the Saeghe 2, a more advanced variant with a tandem warhead to defeat explosive reactive armor,and the Saeghe 4, with a thermobaric warhead. Despite being essentially obsolete, Saegheh anti tank guided missiles have been exported to Syria, Hezbollah, and Shia militias in Yemen and Iraq. The Saeghe 1 and Saeghe 2 were in production and service as of 2011, though they were not widely deployed. The Saeghe ATGM is extremely hard to aim and operate and in Iranian service it appears to be limited to IRGC and rapid response forces.

He criticized the US for not allowing the use of American-made weapons for deep strikes into enemy territory, calling it “goading.” Antonov accused the Biden administration of behaving deceptively, comparing it to someone extending one hand while holding a dagger behind their back. He stated that meaningful dialogue between the US and Russia will only happen if Washington ends its “hostile policy,” including support for Ukraine and sanctions against Moscow.

In a landmark visit to Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered “as a friend” to help bring peace to Ukraine in a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with many in the war-torn country hoping that it would pave the way for an Indian role in peace mediation.

This first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history came at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Russia is making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.

instagram,"""Antony Blinken’s decades of experience in top Democratic foreign policy circles brings with it assets and liabilities. On the plus side, he understands the bureaucratic workings of the State Department and the value of traditional alliances, the lack of which demoralized many career diplomats during the Trump administration.

On the negative side, he also comes to the position saddled with the calamitous foreign policy decisions of the elected officials he advised, most notably Biden’s leading role in providing Democratic support as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to authorize the Bush administration’s illegal war on Iraq.

Although Biden eventually expressed regret for this mistake, as late as this year, Blinken was still deceptively referring to the authorization for use of force against Iraq as a “vote for tough diplomacy.”

More recently, as a senior foreign policy figure in the Obama administration, Blinken shares in the blame for the president’s incoherent, piecemeal, and unprincipled response to the Arab Spring, which consisted of a combination of questionably unauthorized uses of force against long-time adversaries and a studied indifference to the repression inflicted by brutal allies against their citizens.""

Today It is something different and sadly is still currently  waging/going on right now. Today i will be giving you a brief understanding of the Syrian and Yemeni Civil war. 

So the Syrian Civil war started in 2011  It is an ongoing multi-sided civil war in Syria fought between the Ba'athist Syrian Arab Republic led by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, along with domestic and foreign allies, and various domestic and foreign forces opposing both the Syrian government and each other in varying combinations. This also involved the rise of a horrifying extremist/terrorist group who committed acts of terror killing thousands whilst trying to promote Extremism and terror using Religion (Will not be naming them due to the respect for all victims that suffered at the hands of these horrible people) The terrorist group were thankfully dealt with and eliminated by Syrian National Army amongst other allies who helped like the US. The war is still ongoing.

The Yemeni Civil War is is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015 between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi-led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. War still ongoing.

Yemen is going through one of the worst man made humanitarian crises as a result of the ongoing civil war. Though Yemen was always besieged with internal conflicts since its unification in 1990, the severity of fighting and destruction is the current phase of civil war since 2015 is unimaginable.

Most of Yemen's 3,500 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in air strikes, and only half are thought to be fully functioning. As of early this year, it has added another layer to the war: the failing healthcare infrastructure and the rise of COVID-19. 

Much of the current conflict can only be understood as a result of the events of the latter half of the 20th century. A brief look at the history that has shaped today’s wars in Yemen is given in  a series of six short explanatory articles.

instagram,"This is the Great Marib Dam. Built in the 8th century BCE, it was one of the truly great architectural marvels of the ancient Mediterranean world. It also signified the power and grandeur of the ancient civilisations that resided in Yemen such as the Sabaeans and Himyarites. Slide along and you will see other images that attest to this nations' historic prosperity and cultural richness. Indeed, Yemen's wealth was unmatched in the Arabian peninsula well into the second millennium. This is made all the more surprising by the fact that today, Yemen is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia and remains in the thrall of a complicated and devastating war. There are no consolations we can offer to the horrors that have occurred there, though we sincerely hope that Yemen - and the international community, who is fully implicated in the disaster - can bring about the peace that Yemenis deserve. With that, perhaps Yemen might one day return to its former glory.

Slide along to see images of the Great Mosque of Sana'a, the Dar al Hajar in Wadi Dhar, and the ancient skyscraper city of Shibam.

📸 Photography © Editions Gelbart

🇬🇧 The war in Yemen is dragging on and has led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. This internationalized conflict has also damaged Yemen's cultural heritage including the historic town of Zabid. The former capital of Yemen from the 13th to the 15th century has an exceptional historical value. Firstly because it had a key importance in the history of the Arab and Muslim world, secondly because it contains relics and historic buildings including 86 mosques and houses in the Tihama style and finally because the organization of its urban plan and its military architecture makes it unique. The air strikes of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia on Zabid and the looting of the historical library by the Houthist forces supported by Iran are examples showing the consequences of war, destroying our universal past and memory.

🇫🇷 La guerre au Yémen s’éternise et a entraîné la pire crise humanitaire actuelle dans le monde. Ce conflit internationalisé a aussi endommagé le patrimoine culturel yéménite dont la ville historique de Zabid. L’ancienne capitale du Yémen du XIIIe au XVe siècle, a une valeur historique exceptionnelle. D’abord parce qu’elle a eu une importance clé dans l’histoire du monde arabe et musulman, ensuite parce qu’elle recèle de reliques et d’édifices historiques dont 86 mosquées et maisons de style Tihama et enfin parce que l’organisation de son tissu urbain et son architecture militaire la rend unique. Les frappes aériennes de la coalition dirigée par l’Arabie saoudite sur la ville mais aussi le pillage de la bibliothèque historique par les forces houthistes soutenues par l’Iran mettent aujourd’hui en péril cette mémoire universelle qui se doit d’être protégée pour les populations actuelles et futures.

instagram,"IMT Hyderabad takes immense pride in announcing the research paper titled “Reflection of public perception of Russia-Ukraine conflict and Metaverse on the financial outlook of Metaverse coins: Fresh evidence from Reddit Sentiment Analysis” authored by our distinguished faculty member Prof. (Dr.) Indranil Ghosh (Assistant Professor, IT & Analytics), co-authored by Dr. Esteban Alfaro- Cortés, Dr. Matías Gámez and Dr. Noelia García-Rubio has secured successful publication in the prestigious journal “International Reviews of Financial Analysis”.

The study investigates the relationship between Metaverse coin prices and social media attitudes about the Russia-Ukraine war and Metaverse potential. Using Wavelet Coherence Analysis, the research uncovers a short-term link between these factors. Furthermore, Reddit sentiment analysis on both topics demonstrates their influence on Metaverse coin prices. Forecasting is done using nonlinear approaches such as UMAP and PSO-tuned XGBR, with XAI interpreting the findings. The study concludes that short-term media discussion and Reddit sentiment can effectively forecast Metaverse coin price patterns.

instagram,"Fighting intensifies in the Yemeni province of Marib as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels push closer towards the city. Sources told the Hindu, that at least 90 combatants have been killed in less than 24 hours on Saturday.

The fighting in Yemen which has been raging on since 2014 has left many displaced and killed. The Civil war in Yemen is being fought between an Iranian-backed Houthi armed movement and the internationally recognized Hadi-led Yemeni government-backed mostly by Saudi Arabia. The lives of civilians have become catastrophic.

The city of Marib, located between Sana’a and Sa’dah (which are under the control of the Houthis) is the last stronghold for the Yemeni Government in the Northern part of the country. The loss of Marib would be a huge blow to the Saudi-led coalition as the area is also rich in oil but moreover, it would threaten the lives of countless citizens of the city as well as those in refugee camps situated in the province.

The siege of the city was started last month by the Houthis and after a steady advance, a three-prong offensive was launched into the city. The area is under constant threat of ballistic missiles from both sides and a long battle for the city seems to be in the offing. US Secretary of state, Antony Blinken has urged the Houthis to halt their advance as he announced $191 million in aid.

instagram,"OTR-21 Tochka Tactical ballistic missile of the Soviet Union
-
The OTR-21 is a mobile missile launch system, designed to be deployed along with other land combat units on the battlefield. While the 9K52 Luna-M is large and relatively inaccurate, the OTR-21 is much smaller. The missile itself can be used for precise strikes on enemy tactical targets, such as control posts, bridges, storage facilities, troop concentrations and airfields. The fragmentation warhead can be replaced with a nuclear, biological or chemical warhead. The solid propellant makes the missile easy to maintain and deploy. OTR-21 units are usually managed in a brigade structure. There are 18 launchers in a brigade; each launcher is provided with 2 or 3 missiles. The vehicle is completely amphibious, with a maximum road speed of 60 km/h (37 mph) and 8 km/h (5.0 mph) in water. It is NBC-protected. The system has been in development since 1968. Three variants were developed.
-
Warhead : Chemical, 100 kt nuclear warhead, EMP, or fragmentation filling
-
Engine : Single-stage Solid-fuel rocket
-
Maximum speed : 1.8 km/s (1.1 mi/s; Mach 5.3)
-
Guidance
system : Inertial guidance, Tochka-P added passive radar against radar installations

President Joe Biden is ending the United States’ support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. Yemen has been in a civil war since 2014, it is a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Earlier this month, President Biden called off U.S. support for the war, and instead focused on ending the war.
*
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need and millions on the verge of a large-scale famine. According to UNICEF, with the pandemic spreading, Yemen is facing an “emergency within an emergency.”

Do you see the Biden administration’s act for diplomacy valid and optimistic, maybe even realistically successful? 
Should we maintain military presence for the sake of national security? 
Should we get ourselves involved in humanitarian issues or stay out of them?

.
Houthi rebels reportedly believe Ethiopian migrants are carriers of coronavirus, similar to the stigma and discrimination faced by Black people in China, and have been continually removed from Yemen as the pandemic slowly ravages the region.
.
A researcher at Human Rights Watch says, “United Nations agencies need to step in to address the immediate threats to the Ethiopian migrants and press for accountability for those responsible for the killings and other abuses.”
.
A number of migrants were granted entry to Saudi Arabia only to be detained in harsh facilities with at least 200 migrants are estimated to have escaped and are assumed stranded along the mountainous border.

instagram,"Russia has warned Western countries about the serious consequences of allowing Ukraine to launch deep strikes into Russian territory using Western-supplied missiles. The statement from Moscow comes amid ongoing tensions and conflict in the region.

Earlier this month, Ukraine launched an attack on Russia's western Kursk region, marking the most significant foreign strike on Russian soil since World War II. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin promised that Russia would respond appropriately to the attack.

Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, who has held his position for over two decades, accused the West of provoking a broader conflict by even considering Ukraine's request to relax the restrictions on using foreign weapons. Lavrov described such actions as ""playing with fire.""

He also emphasized the potential global consequences of such a move, warning that if World War III were to occur, it would not be confined to Europe. Lavrov cautioned that Western leaders who control nuclear weapons should recognize the dangers of escalating tensions.

Since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has repeatedly warned of the risks of a broader war involving nuclear powers. However, President Putin has maintained that Russia does not desire a direct conflict with NATO, the U.S.-led military alliance.

Lavrov's comments come as Russia reviews its nuclear policy. According to Russia's 2020 nuclear doctrine, the use of nuclear weapons would be considered only if the nation faced an existential threat, whether from nuclear, mass destruction, or conventional weapons.

instagram,"World on Edge: The Threat of World War III? 🚀

Reported by @firstpost , The world is witnessing a significant escalation in the Ukraine conflict as Russia delivers a chilling warning to the West. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has cautioned that allowing Ukraine to launch deeper strikes into Russian territories is akin to ""playing with fire"" 🔥. Lavrov’s statement, invoking the threat of nuclear retaliation, underscores the gravity of the situation.

With Ukraine urging for more aggressive measures, the possibility of deeper strikes inside Russia has ignited fears of a broader conflict. Lavrov warned that World War III, if it were to occur, wouldn’t be limited to Europe but would have catastrophic global consequences. 🌐

This isn’t the first time Russia has raised the specter of nuclear conflict during the ongoing war. Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly reminded the world that the use of nuclear weapons is not off the table. Dmitry Medvedev, another key Russian figure, has also emphasized that any attack on Russian soil could trigger a devastating response beyond Ukraine’s borders.

As tensions escalate, the international community is on high alert. Are we inching closer to a global conflict? The world watches with bated breath.

""This summer term during the IWP-Oxford Study Abroad, I researched with my tutor, Dr. Mark Almond, looking at Russian military lessons learned from the Russo-Japanese War, from its military rearmament through the First World War.

""The research question was, 'If Russia was prepared for war in 1914, why did things go so wrong by 1917?'

""I looked at what the Russians did and what shortfalls were present and examined what trends we see today in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. My assessment was that similar shortcomings are still drawn out from then to what we see of Russian military shortcomings in Ukraine.

""My study experience at Oxford and New College was filled with academic enrichment and personal fulfillment.""

instagram,"The civil war in Yemen has taken a toll on the healthcare infrastructure of the country. Most of Yemen's 3,500 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in air strikes, and only half are thought to be fully functioning.

In June 2015 itself, aid agencies warned of the humanitarian risks brought by the US and UK-backed Saudi blockades.

According to UNICEF reports, over 3.3 million children and pregnant or lactating women suffer from acute malnutrition. 

In 2017, the World Food Programme estimated that an additional 3.2 million people would be pushed into hunger. If left untreated, 150,000 malnourished children could die within the coming months. 

Save the Children, the international charity and aid agency, estimated that 85,000 children under the age of five have starved to death in between 2015 to 2018. 

A solution to the war must be found soon, before the pandemic eviscerates more of the healthcare infrastructure.

The civil war in Yemen has taken a toll on the healthcare infrastructure of the country. Most of Yemen's 3,500 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in air strikes, and only half are thought to be fully functioning.

In June 2015 itself, aid agencies warned of the humanitarian risks brought by the US and UK-backed Saudi blockades.

According to UNICEF reports, over 3.3 million children and pregnant or lactating women suffer from acute malnutrition. 

In 2017, the World Food Programme estimated that an additional 3.2 million people would be pushed into hunger. If left untreated, 150,000 malnourished children could die within the coming months. 

Save the Children, the international charity and aid agency, estimated that 85,000 children under the age of five have starved to death in between 2015 to 2018. 

A solution to the war must be found soon, before the pandemic eviscerates more of the healthcare infrastructure.

instagram,"I haven’t seen enough of attention being given to the Yemen Crisis on here, at least not in depth. Most people don’t know that it was only recently in the 90’s that Yemen’s Shia-Majority North and Sunni-majority South combined into 1 country (thus the colors of the flag). This civil war began with the “Houthi” (A Zaidi Shia Group) rebellion against the oppresive government, which lead to the death of President Saleh in 2017. The UAE and KSA and even the USA have been supporting the Yemeni Government in their war against the Houthi rebels, who have also caused death and destruction and most would say they no longer fight for a noble cause. Now the whole region is just a dumpster fire which cannot be put out has been fueled even more by the 2019 Cholera Outbreak and Covid-19 as well. Yemen is already a very water-poor country, and hundreds of thousands of displaced families don’t have access to clean water or the means to protect themselves from diseases. UNICEF estimates that a child dies every ten minutes in Yemen of preventable diseases; that is about 50,000 and growing each year. There has been an unprecedented rate of civilian casualties in this war, and the Shias especially, continue to be tormented mentally and physically. The refugees are having a particularly hard time escaping to safety with Covid travel restrictions, and while a cease-fire was attempted, it did not stick. 

Please read more about this crisis at the link in my bio, and help raise awareness. If you are able to donate to relief funds, now is the time, if not, donate your time to learning more about what is happening to our fellow humans (and fellow Muslims).

instagram,"#Replug | Nearly 100 Indians have been recruited by the Russian military over the past year, according to The Hindu. At least 30 Indians have contacted the foreign ministry and the Indian Embassy in Moscow, seeking their help to return home, the newspaper reported on Thursday.

Experts told Scroll that the deaths have brought into focus a dangerous trend of Indians unable to get jobs in the country, becoming victims of labour trafficking rackets, and ending up getting recruited as mercenaries in global conflicts. They argued that the government could have done more to crack down on these rackets.

BBC said, ""It was surely no coincidence that the first place PM Modi was taken...was Ukraine's history museum."" The visit could be an attempt to strike a more neutral stance for India, Associated Press reported citing analysts.

instagram,"A Catholic Reverend father has been ousted by Police authorities for lying to donors after he raised at least $650,000 for overseas medical clinics he claimed to operate, but in reality used the donations to fuel an extravagant lifestyle that included ‘heavenly’ meals, trips to the Hamptons and plastic surgery.

Pawel Bielecki, known as “Father Paul,” claimed he ran medical clinics in war-torn Lebanon, meanwhile he was 5,600 miles away in Manhattan, New York..

“Bielecki exploited his position as a friar to gain the trust of victims across the country and steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from them,” said Damian Williams, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which collared the clergyman on Aug. 17 on charges of wire and mail fraud.
 
For eight years, the priest allegedly preyed on the compassionate members of his flock, soliciting donations on local radio shows and crowdfunding websites for non-existent Lebanese hospitals and ambulances, authorities said.

The cleric allegedly exploited the horrific August 4, 2020 chemical explosion in Beirut, which killed 218 people to fill his wallet, claiming he was hurt in the attack.

But prosecutors said he wasn’t even there and “made several purchases at coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses” in Manhattan on the day of the disaster.

Arriving in Kyiv by 'Rail Force One' from Poland, PM Modi received a ceremonial welcome at the Kyiv Central Railway Station. Despite the ongoing conflict with Russia, the visit highlighted India's commitment to peace and humanitarian aid.

During his visit, PM Modi paid tribute to Gandhiji at the ‘Oasis of Peace’ park, emphasizing the relevance of Gandhiji's message of peace in today’s global challenges. He also visited the Martyrologist exposition at the National Museum of History of Ukraine, where he was deeply moved by the memorial dedicated to children who lost their lives in the conflict.

PM Modi held fruitful discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Maryinskyi Palace, where they reviewed bilateral ties and signed agreements in agriculture, medical products, and cultural cooperation. PM Modi reiterated India's stance for peace and offered to mediate in the Russia-Ukraine conflict without taking sides.

As a gesture of humanitarian support, PM Modi handed over four BHISHM Cubes, containing medicines and medical equipment, to President Zelenskyy. Additionally, PM Modi interacted with Ukrainian students learning Hindi, commending their efforts to promote Indian culture in Ukraine.

PM Modi's visit underscored India's growing role in global diplomacy, with his ability to engage both Russia and Ukraine, demonstrating India's commitment to peace and humanitarian assistance amidst the ongoing conflict.

Both leaders emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving such critical issues.
President Zelenskyy, expressing his gratitude, described the meeting as ""historical,"" underscoring that it was about the nations and their people rather than individual leaders. The discussions highlighted the shared values of democracy, sovereignty, and the right to peaceful coexistence.

Israel’s sweeping airstrikes across Lebanon have raised the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to a new peak. 

This latest surge in hostilities comes on the heels of last week’s mysterious explosions targeting pagers and walkie-talkies throughout Lebanon, which left several dead and a nation on edge. In response to the Israeli attacks, Hezbollah fired over 180 rockets towards northern Israel.

According to the state news agency IRNA, the explosion was brought on by a sudden leak of carbon monoxide and methane on Saturday night in two blocks of the Tabas mine in the Khorasan region.

Approximately seventy people were at the mine when the explosion occurred, according to the local authorities.

Iranian authorities claimed that underground conditions made it difficult to conduct a quick rescue effort.

An investigation into the incident has been ordered by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.

instagram,"„Man erreicht keinen Frieden dadurch, dass man alle Feinde tötet,“ sagte Ami Ajalon in einem Interview mit Zeit Online.

Diese Einsicht zieht sich wie ein roter Faden durch sein Buch „Im eigenen Feuer“, in dem der frühere israelische Geheimdienstchef und sozialistische Knesset-Abgeordnete seine militärische und geheimdienstliche Laufbahn reflektiert.

Ami Ajalon schildert eindrucksvoll, wie er sich vom „Falken“ zu einem scharfen Kritiker der israelischen Politik wandelte. Er schreibt mit großer Ehrlichkeit über die zerstörerischen Folgen eines Lebens im Anti-Terror-Krieg und die Notwendigkeit, Palästinenser nicht als Feinde, sondern als Menschen mit Rechten zu sehen.

Seine Memoiren sind ein eindringliches Plädoyer für Selbstreflexion und Empathie. Diese fordert er auch von der israelischen Gesellschaft ein. „Unsere mangelnde Empathie unterminierte unsere Fähigkeit, Gefahren und Chancen richtig einzuschätzen.“

Ein tief bewegender Text, der die Standpunkte beider Seiten erfasst und in einer Zeit des Stillstands im Friedensprozess neue Wege zur Verständigung eröffnet.

One of my followers sent these incarceration cards from their great aunt’s internment at Buchenwald (the other photo is an example of a card).I am deeply honoured that this person wanted to share these with me, and they are shared with their permission. 

My gut reaction to these cards was sobbing. They weren’t only Jews held at Buchenwald. Australian and allied POWS, the disabled and infirm, gays, and Romani’s were there. 2 priests were crucified upside down there. Large scale human experimentation took place in Buchenwald. Everyone held in Buchenwald had these cards. 

Now if I cried understanding the meaning of these cards and those triangles as a Jew, imagine the trauma of the descendants of Buchenwald prisoners seeing the scum of the earth walking Australian streets week after week, or targeting people they’ve never met before in their lives with the murder triangles because free Palestine. I don’t believe it’s ignorance, I believe it’s a level of malicious evil that has to be stopped.

Al Jazeera condemned the closure, calling it a violation of human rights and an effort to suppress press freedom.

The Gaza Government Media Office described the raid as a scandal and a blatant violation of press freedom.

Al Jazeera has consistently faced restrictions and attacks on its journalists, including the killing of reporter Ismail Al-Ghoul in Gaza.

instagram,"Ukraine has launched one of its largest drone attacks on Moscow, as it presses on with a major incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, Russian authorities said.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday that air defence forces shot down 11 drones over Moscow and its surrounding region, with some reportedly downed over the city of Podolsk some 38km (24 miles) south of the Kremlin.

“This is one of the largest ever attempts to attack Moscow with drones,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app. No damage or casualties were reported, he said in an earlier post.

Drone attacks on Moscow are rare. Ukraine’s latest attempt to target the Russian capital appeared to be larger than a previous attack in May 2023, when at least eight drones were struck down.

Wednesday’s barrage was part of a broader attack on Russia, with the Defence Ministry saying its air defence units destroyed 45 Ukrainian drones in total overnight.

In addition to the 11 drones destroyed over the Moscow region, 23 drones were downed in the border region of Bryansk, six in the border region of Belgorod, three in the Kaluga region, which borders the Moscow region to its northeast, and two in the embattled Kursk region, the ministry said.

This was announced by Oleksii Drozdenko, the head of military administration in northeastern Ukraine, on the 12th day of Kyiv’s surprise offensive. According to him, many of the captured soldiers are young conscripts tasked with guarding the southwestern Russian border. Some of them also admitted that they did not want to fight the advancing Ukrainian troops. The high number of Russian prisoners of war and the relatively low number of casualties on Kyiv’s side only prove that the cross-border offensive has been a major success so far, Drozdenko told The Guardian.

instagram,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited the border areas in the Sumy region from which his forces staged a major offensive into Russia’s Kursk region this month.

The president said on Thursday that he had met Oleksandr Syrskii, commander-in-chief of the army, receiving reports on the “operational situation across all active combat zones”, in a video posted on social media platform X.

The Ukrainian army’s surprise incursion into Kursk on August 6 saw it take control of dozens of settlements, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee and taking hundreds of prisoners captive.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine had “replenished the exchange fund”, a reference to the capture of Russian soldiers who could be exchanged for Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Moscow.

Ukrainian officials have said the goals of the offensive included creating a “buffer zone” on Russian territory, seeking an end to the war on “fair” terms and stretching Russian forces.

In his statement on Thursday, the president said there had been a decrease in shelling and civilian casualties in Sumy since the Kursk operation.

Abbas Araqchi made his remarks one day after the senior diplomat of the European Union stated that the union is thinking of imposing additional sanctions on Iran's aviation industry in response to rumors that Tehran had given Russia ballistic missiles to use in its conflict with Ukraine.

""Iran remains strong on its own course, but we've always been willing to hold discussions to settle disagreements. However, communication needs to be founded on respect for one another rather than coercion and threats, Araqchi stated, as reported by the official news agency IRNA.

प्रधानमंत्री का गर्मजोशी के साथ हुआ स्वागत 
पोलैंड से रेल फोर्स वन पर 10 घंटे की ट्रेन यात्रा के बाद कीव पहुंचने पर प्रधानमंत्री मोदी का स्टेशन पर गर्मजोशी से स्वागत किया गया। इसके बाद वे शुरुआती बैठकों के लिए हयात होटल पहुंचे, जहां भारतीय प्रवासियों ने उनका उत्साहपूर्वक स्वागत किया। प्रधानमंत्री मोदी की यात्रा का मुख्य उद्देश्य रूस-यूक्रेन विवाद के शांतिपूर्ण समाधान पर चर्चा करना है। भारत को दोनों देशों के बीच मध्यस्थता में संभावित रूप से रचनात्मक भूमिका निभाने के रूप में देखा जा रहा है।

प्रधानमंत्री मोदी ने दिल्ली से रवाना होने से पहले कहा, ""मैं राष्ट्रपति जेलेंस्की के साथ द्विपक्षीय सहयोग को मजबूत करने तथा चल रहे यूक्रेन संघर्ष के शांतिपूर्ण समाधान पर विचारों को साझा करने के लिए पहले की बातचीत को आगे बढ़ाने के अवसर की प्रतीक्षा कर रहा हूं।"" प्रधानमंत्री मोदी की यह यात्रा उनकी मॉस्को यात्रा और रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन के साथ बैठक के लगभग छह सप्ताह बाद हो रही है, जिस पर पश्चिमी देशों ने आपत्ति जताई थी।

Russia has claimed that Western weapons were used in the recent attack on a bridge in Kursk. This assertion has intensified tensions and drawn further scrutiny of international arms supplies to the conflict.

instagram,"A Russian court sentenced US-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina to 12 years in prison on charges of ""treason"" after she allegedly donated around $50 to a pro-Ukraine charity. Karelina, a 32-year-old ballerina who had been living in Los Angeles, was arrested while visiting family in Yekaterinburg in January. The Russian FSB claimed that the funds she collected were used to purchase supplies and equipment for the Ukrainian armed forces. Karelina reportedly pleaded guilty to the charges last week, according to Russian state media.

This sentencing occurs amid heightened tensions between Russia and the West, particularly following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Just two weeks prior, Russia released 16 prisoners with US and other Western citizenships in a major prisoner swap, the largest since the Cold War. The case of Karelina, along with others involving Western citizens, highlights ongoing concerns that Russia is imprisoning foreigners on questionable charges to use them as leverage in diplomatic negotiations.
Source: AFP, Reuters

So what
I guess following the large prisoner exchange that occurred a few weeks ago Russia is in need of some new prisoners for bargaining. Though this charge seems quite straightforward when compared to previous political prisoners, it is similar to what would happen to people who are caught raising money for terror groups in the West. Of note around this is some reporting about Russia initiating talks to exchange prisoners for the first time in the conflict, following the capture of some FSB units during Ukraine’s attack on Kursk. It could be possible Russia plans to use Karelina to pressure Ukraine into a trade for these forces.

The school, located in the Nuseirat refugee camp, was sheltering over 12,000 displaced Palestinians. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called the strike a violation of international humanitarian law and demanded an immediate halt to the violence in Gaza.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) defended the strike, claiming it was a targeted operation against Hamas members using the school as a command center. However, no evidence was provided to support this claim, and the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reported the attack as the deadliest single incident involving its staff.

instagram,"The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region on Ukraine’s northern border has declared a regional state of emergency blaming relentless bombardment by Ukraine.

“The situation in the Belgorod region continues to be extremely difficult and tense,” Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.

Daily shelling by Ukraine’s armed forces had destroyed houses, and had killed and injured civilians, he added.

“Therefore, we are making a decision, starting today, to declare a regional emergency situation throughout the Belgorod region … with a subsequent appeal to the government to declare a federal emergency situation.”

Gladkov’s announcement comes as Russia battles to push back Ukrainian forces in neighbouring Kursk after thousands of soldiers launched a surprise assault across the border in the early hours of August 6.

L'accusa è di aver attraversato ""illegalmente"" il confine, entrando nella Federazione russa dall'Ucraina. Lo ha riferito il servizio stampa dell'Fsb come riportano le agenzie russe.

L'Fsb ""ha aperto un'indagine penale"" contro la giornalista Stefania Battistini e l'operatore Simone Traini per ""attraversamento illegale della frontiera"", hanno riferito i Servizi in un comunicato. L'ambasciatrice italiana in Russia, Cecilia Piccioni, è stata convocata a Mosca dal ministero degli Esteri in relazione al caso.l'Fsb ha anche fatto sapere che sta effettuando ""una valutazione giuridica dei materiali distribuiti dai media che indicano la presenza sul territorio del posto di controllo russo di Sudzha del corrispondente Nick Paton Walsh"". ""Sulla base dei cui risultati verrà presa una decisione procedurale"", si legge nel comunicato rilanciato dalle agenzie russe.

Come i due inviati della Rai, anche Nick Paton Walsh della Cnn ha firmato un reportage dalla città di Sudzha, di cui le truppe ucraine hanno rivendicato il controllo nell'ambito della loro offensiva in corso nella regione di Kursk da oltre 10 giorni.

*
Russia has imposed a ""counter-terrorism operation"" in three regions to halt a Ukrainian incursion. Now, authorities in Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk can restrict movement and tap phones.

This after Ukrainian troops advanced 10km into Russia, the deepest since the invasion in February 2022.

Russia's National Counter-Terrorism Committee says it's to ensure public safety. Powers include home entry, traffic control, and electronic monitoring.

76,000 have been evacuated from Kursk. Up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops have reportedly seized multiple villages and threaten Sudzha town.

A video shows armed Ukrainians at Sudzha's Gazprom facility, confirmed by BBC Verify. Another video shows a damaged Russian convoy near Oktyabrskoe.

Russia sent reinforcements, including tanks and rocket systems. Moscow claims to be repelling the invasion, but these claims are unverified.

As fighting nears Kursk nuclear plant, the UN urges ""maximum restraint"" to avoid a nuclear accident.

*
Zelensky's like, ""Russia, feel this!"" as Ukraine hits back in Kursk. He says Moscow needs a taste of its own borscht for invading Ukraine. And as always, President Putin is like, ""Major provocation!""

Ukraine stays mum, but it's clear they mean business, advancing 10km into Russian territory. Russia’s all, ""We're destroying them,"" yet local leaders near Kursk are telling everyone to skedaddle.

Meanwhile, even the White House is like, ""Wait, what's the plan here?"" 

And just when you thought things couldn't get spicier, Ukraine allegedly took over a major gas hub. Gas is still flowing, though—so there's that.

instagram,"📌 The Ukrainian military will need to neutralize Russian air defense systems from the rear in order to use Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets. According to a recent analysis by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) following confirmation that the first batch of F-16 aircraft has arrived in Kyiv. The ISW is urging Ukraine to destroy Russian air defense assets before flying its F-16s to avoid being targeted. Moscow’s air defenses have been hindering Ukrainian efforts, requiring action to counter them.

With only a few Russian athletes allowed to compete as neutrals, stripped of national symbols, this exclusion underscores the broader geopolitical tensions and the impact of the Ukraine conflict on global sports.

*
Here’s the rundown for Saturday, August 3, 2024:

Ukraine's military hit Russia’s Morozovsk airfield and several oil depots overnight. Russia says it shot down 76 Ukrainian drones, while Ukraine claims it took down 24 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia.

Zelenskyy says Russia used more than 600 bombs on Ukraine last week, as Russian forces intensify pressure on Pokrovsk in Donetsk.

On the diplomatic front, Ukraine exchanged 250 soldier remains in the largest swap to date. Over 110 countries reportedly support Beijing's peace plan, while Russian activist Ilya Yashin, freed in a swap, claims he was deported without consent. The National Bank of Ukraine forecast a rising exodus, estimating 700,000 people to leave over the next two years.

Unlike the strike by the pro-Ukrainian Russian forces, this operation was carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces themselves.
Since Ukraine has maintained absolute silence on battlefield information, we can only learn about the situation from a few sources such as on-site videos and articles by pro-Russian bloggers. Few Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles and vehicles were destroyed, while some Russian military helicopters and personnel were destroyed, and some personnel were captured.
May God bless all the brave Ukrainian fighters who took part in this operation,and wish good results.

instagram,"Hollow Peace Propositions

Amid the never ending conflict between Ukraine and Russia, discussions about a potential peace settlement have gained a facade of momentum. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s recent suggestion of holding a referendum to let the Ukrainian people decide on territorial concessions is nothing more than a distraction. Zelensky’s statement, made during an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, appears to be a desperate move to placate a war-weary populace.

The feasibility of such a referendum is laughable. Furthermore, the Ukrainian Constitution does not allow for a plebiscite on territorial changes, making the suggestion a political ruse. Despite these obvious hurdles, Zelensky’s simulated optimism about the prospects of peace, claiming his administration is committed to preparing a viable peace settlement by the end of the year is a ruse.

*
In a plot twist worthy of a spy novel, two Russian dissidents, Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin, were released in a prisoner swap but refused to sign a mercy petition to Putin. During a Germany press conference, they vowed to return home, stressing their opposition to Putin's war in Ukraine. The swap also freed US journalist Evan Gerschkovich and ex-Marine Paul Whelan, while convict assassin Vadim Krasikov got a get-out-of-jail-free card. The dissidents pledged to fight for a free Russia and criticized the ethics of the swap. Kara-Murza, who was held in solitary for over 10 months, likened his release to a surreal movie. Yashin, still longing to return to Russia, acknowledged that his presence complicates further negotiations. Sasha Skochilenko echoed the surreal experience, ecstatic to reunite with family. They paid tribute to the late critic Alexei Navalny, asserting Putin's direct role in his death, and insisted that Russia deserves better than a ""corrupt KGB dictator.""

instagram,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised Ukrainian forces for hitting military targets inside Russia after the army reported several attacks, including on an airfield and an oil depot.

“I would like to thank each of our soldiers and all those who work in our defence industry for striking Russian airfields, oil refineries and logistics,” he said in a statement on Saturday.

Kyiv has stepped up aerial attacks on Russian territory, saying it carries out the attacks in retaliation for the bombardment Ukraine has faced since Russia invaded more than two years ago.

Earlier on Saturday, Ukraine’s military said it had sunk a submarine in Russian-controlled Sevastopol, attacked a southern Russian airfield and hit oil depots and fuel and lubricant storage facilities in Belgorod, Kursk and Rostov regions.

“A Russian submarine went to the bottom of the Black Sea,” the Ministry of Defence said in a post on X, naming the vessel as the B-237 Rostov-on-Don attack submarine.

The military’s general staff said the attack on Sevastopol port also significantly damaged four launchers of the S-400 anti-aircraft “Triumf” defence system.

instagram,"The first batch of long-awaited F-16 jets have arrived in Ukraine, Lithuania’s foreign minister and a United States official have said, an effort Kyiv has said will help rebuild its depleted air force.

Ukraine has been eager to acquire F-16s, built by Lockheed Martin, because of their destructive power and global availability.  The fighter jet is equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles.

“F-16s in Ukraine. Another impossible thing turned out to be totally possible,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis wrote on X on Wednesday.

A US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the delivery had been completed. The Ukrainian government has not confirmed receipt of the jets.

Ukraine has been pushing its Western allies for F-16s for months, saying they were critical in fighting back against the onslaught of missiles Russia has fired against it. The West has moved haltingly towards providing the jets, after previous concerns that arming Ukraine with advanced weaponry would further escalate the war with Russia.

The US has also been training Ukrainian pilots on how to fly the jets and has already graduated the first group of pilots on its operation.

instagram,"The Israel-Palestine conflict traces back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Jewish and Arab nationalistic aspirations clashed over the same land. After World War II, the creation of Israel in 1948 sparked intense conflict, leading to wars in 1948, 1967, and beyond. Israel established control over key territories such as the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967. Palestinians demand statehood, sovereignty over the occupied territories, and the right to return for refugees displaced by the conflict.

Presently, peace efforts remain stagnant, with Israel expanding settlements in the West Bank and Palestinian factions divided between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Violent clashes continue, fueled by deep-seated grievances.

The future remains uncertain. While some push for a two-state solution, others argue for a binational state or separate paths, but political and ideological divides make any resolution elusive.

After so much bloodshed and bodies still under the rubble, the population repeatedly asked the entire world for a ceasefire. 
The world population rose up to demand urgent aid for Palestine. 

No nation has actually done anything on Palestinian soil. Your response was silence - more bodies and wounded. 

Currently Rafah is the most populated area in the world, deprived of drinking water, food and medical care/materials. 

The orphan rate continues to grow.

We helplessly witness a Genocide hoping that a country will stop this carnage, stop the sale of military equipment.

There is no safe place, even in the camps.

En ce moment Rafah est la zone la plus peuplée au monde, dépourvue d’eau potable, de nourriture et de soins/matériels médicaux. 

Le taux d’orphelins ne cesse de croître.

instagram,"An Israeli airstrike on a designated humanitarian zone in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 40 people and injured dozens more, according to Gaza's civil defence authorities. The strike targeted the Mawasi area in Khan Younis, which had been identified by Israel as a humanitarian zone. Local civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughair confirmed the death toll, and both the Hamas-linked Shehab news agency and Fatah-linked Wafa news agency corroborated the reports of 40 fatalities. The impact of the strike caused extensive damage, with over 20 tents catching fire and craters up to nine meters deep left in the area.

In response, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the target was a Hamas command centre, accusing Hamas of using human shields within the civilian and humanitarian infrastructure. Hamas denied the presence of its fighters in the area, calling the claims a ""blatant lie."" The IDF further alleged that Palestinian militant groups have consistently exploited humanitarian zones for terrorist activities against Israel. The incident adds to the escalating conflict, deepening the humanitarian crisis in the region.
Source: AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa

So what
It will be interesting to see what comes of this strike. Numerous commentators online mentioned how abnormal this strike was even for Israel and speculated that the targets must have been important. However, it will likely come at the cost of significant public backlash; even if they can show clear signs that they hit military targets, the general public will likely criticize the strike. Yet it seems like Israel no longer cares about the opinion of the general international community so long as they maintain US support.

instagram,"Israel continues to massacre Palestinians in Gaza using American bombs supplied by Washington, intensifying accusations of genocide. The Israeli military has deployed powerful US-made munitions to strike a so-called “humanitarian safe zone” in southern Gaza, burying entire families, according to a Geneva-based human rights group.

Early Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes on a refugee tent camp in Khan Younis, located in the al-Mawasi area, resulted in at least 40 Palestinians killed and dozens more injured. This zone had been designated by Israel as a “humanitarian zone” for displaced civilians seeking refuge from the ongoing violence. Gaza’s civil defense service reported that the Israeli bombs created craters as deep as nine meters, devastating the camp.

The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor confirmed that Israeli warplanes dropped three US-made MK-84 bombs, each weighing 900 kg, on the camp while civilians were sleeping. These bombs were among the more than 14,000 transferred from the US to Israel in 2023 and 2024, according to media reports.

The targeting of civilians coerced into relocating to designated ""safe zones"" and then bombed during the night highlights America’s direct complicity in what many are calling the Palestinian genocide.

""The bombs caused craters as deep as several meters, burying about 20 tents with families inside,"" the rights group said. ""Many tents, with entire families inside, were buried under the sand.""

Euro-Med condemned the global silence, stating that it emboldens Israel to continue its atrocities.

The group further emphasized the role of the US, which provides Israel with the weapons used to kill civilians, labeling America a partner in these crimes.

instagram,"Following his passing in July, Dr. Ismail Haniyeh, the late leader of Hamas, was the subject of proceedings that the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced on Friday, according to Reuters.

A request for arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders issued earlier this year is presently being considered by the ICC.

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, requested arrest warrants for Hamas leaders in May. He claimed that there were good reasons to believe Yahya Sinwar, Dr. Ismail Haniyeh, and military chief Mohammed Al-Masri were criminally responsible for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The prosecutor declared in the same announcement that he was also requesting arrest warrants for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. No updates about those requests have been received.

instagram,"Minilateralism ,the brand new way to conflict resolution:

Why and how minilateralism ?

Proper implementation of law requires its enforcement and enforcement requires a central superior authority that's not biased nor coerced.Since international law is considered a weak law, as there's no central superior authority nor there's way to strictly prevent a crime or implement a solution for any conflict, as in today's world the Palestine issue.
the perspective of world is now shifting towards the close cooperative conflict resolution as minilateralism.Which ensures that justice is offered to all parties and conflict resolution is rational.

Minilateralism provides a forum to negotiate on mutual interests and future sustainable goals.For instantiation ,the UAE and Indonesia and five other states started an initiative with the name of ""Mangrove Alliance for Climate"" at COP'27 (conference of parties) in Egypt.QUAD (Quadrilateral security dialogue) is also an example of minilateralism.Quad is a group where big nations are cooperating in a small group.In international arena minilateralism is considered an effective solution as compared to multilateralism to make fruitful negotiations; especially When it comes to disastrous conflicts like Syrian conflict, Palestine conflict , Russo-Ukrainian war and South China sea.

According to an ISM statement, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was part of a peaceful rally in Beita against illegal Israeli settlements when the Israeli army opened fire.

The Movement stated that Eygi was standing with other human rights monitors when she was fatally shot in the head by a sniper, making her the 18th protester slain in Beita since 2020.

Rather, I speak as a Muslim American who has been nurtured amidst a milieu of diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.

Ihab was a member of Reporters Without Borders, and because he’s critical of Hamas and Israel had nothing to do with his disappearance, the Australian media (‘independent’ and mainstream) likely won’t report on this. 

If you are free press in Gaza, you will likely pay for it with your life and that is all there is to it. Tipping my hat to Ihab and his bravery today.

«Мадонна с автоматами» - одно из известных произведений Бэнкси, которое представляет собой дерзкую и провокационную интерпретацию традиционного религиозного образа.
На работе изображена фигура Мадонны, держащей в руках автоматы, что контрастирует с классическим образом Богоматери, которая ассоциируется с миром, состраданием и материнской заботой. 
Все это интерпретируется как критика милитаризма, религиозного фанатизма и насилия, которое иногда прикрывается религиозными или политическими идеями. 
Сам образ святой Мадонны, традиционно связанный с миром и защитой, противопоставляется образу вооруженной женщины, что подчеркивает абсурдность и жестокость вооруженных конфликтов.

With a proposed multi-billion-dollar EU loan earmarked for air defense, energy, and domestic weapons purchases, Zelensky emphasized that most decisions depend on US President Joe Biden's goodwill and support. The Ukrainian leader's ""victory plan"" aims to establish favorable terms after over two years of conflict, and swift decisions between October and December are crucial. Zelensky's upcoming meeting with Biden in the US next week is pivotal, as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defense against Russia's ongoing aggression. Ukraine's victory would be a global triumph for independence and international law, and Zelensky is counting on Biden's support to bring peace and strengthen his country.

From defending Ukraine against Russian forces and maintenance of intricate relations with China and Iran to some very controversial issues like the stance which Israel took over Gaza, Harris's presidency is definitely going to be thorny. 

Tensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dilemma would turn into one of the critical battlegrounds against former President Donald Trump, who has come out against Biden's approach. The viewpoint on foreign policy is different, though, as experts believe that under the leadership of Harris, her administration would toe the same policies as Biden's government, with continued support to NATO and Ukraine amid realignment in domestic and international politics.

Key takeaways:
Russian troops are making strategic gains near Kharkiv, posing new challenges for Ukrainian defenses.
Delays in U.S. arms shipments and Russian innovations in electronic warfare have tilted the balance on the battlefield.

While American officials remain confident in reversing Russian gains with increased arms support, uncertainties loom over future developments.
As the conflict enters a critical phase, observers anticipate potential outcomes ranging from negotiated ceasefires to prolonged frozen conflicts.

Currently Rafah is the most populated area in the world, deprived of drinking water, food and medical care/materials.

We helplessly witness a Genocide hoping that a country will stop this carnage, stop the sale of military equipment.

There is no safe place, even in the camps.

En ce moment Rafah est la zone la plus peuplée au monde, dépourvue d’eau potable, de nourriture et de soins/matériels médicaux. 

Le taux d’orphelins ne cesse de croître.

instagram,"《六名以色列人質證實被殺害、以色列爆全國示威至少50萬人參與》

以色列全國週末爆發大型示威，首都特拉維夫（Tel Aviv)及耶路撒冷（Jerusalem)街頭佈滿人潮，有示威者堵塞道路，於總理官邸前示威，甚至放火，警方出動水炮車及催淚氣體驅趕，當地媒體指至少29人被捕。

除示威外，各界工會領袖更組織今日進行全國大罷工，週一早上起，位於特拉維夫市近郊、全國運力最大——本古裡安機場(Ben Gurion Airport)會暫停運作，料多班航班受影響。

示威者質疑以色列政府未有致力達成停火協議及解救人質，早前以色列軍隊於加沙南部拉法市（Rafah)一處隧道中，尋擭六名人質屍體，當局指六人疑被哈馬斯近距離擊斃，料受害者已經死亡48-72小時。

面對國內外輿論壓力，以色列總理內塔尼亞湖（Benjamin Netanyahu) 堅持要追究哈馬斯，強調殺害人質者根本無意達成任何協議。

美國總統拜登（Joe Biden)就表示，對哈馬斯殺害美籍以國公民感悲痛及憤慨，重申哈馬斯要為罪行負上代價，承諾會致力達成協議及解救人質，仍然對達成停火協議感樂觀，雖然美國、埃及及卡塔爾都不斷促進談判，但始終無積極性進展，雙方依然拒絕就撤出加沙讓步。

另一方面，哈馬斯高級成員薩米·阿布·祖布里 （Sami Abu Zubri）就反斥內塔尼亞湖拒絕達成協議，認為內塔尼亞湖需要為人質被殺負責，而現時以色列人需要於內塔尼亞湖及停火協議之間作出抉擇。

加沙戰事已經持續近9個月，加沙仍然有230萬人流離失所，超過40,000人死亡，民眾處於嚴重飢餓及衞生惡劣環境。

instagram,"Tens of thousands of Israelis came to the streets in one of the largest nationwide protests since Israel’s war on Hamas began, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to obtain a ceasefire-for-hostages agreement.

The scope of the strike early Monday remained unclear, but supporters have promised a countrywide response.

Israeli officials told CNN that three of the six captives found dead, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were supposed to be released in the event of a truce. Autopsies revealed that they were shot at close range on Thursday or Friday morning; Israeli forces confirmed the retrieval of their bodies from an underground passage near Rafah on Saturday.

instagram,"Israel is tightening the noose around Palestinians by forcibly transferring them into an increasingly narrow area no more than 10 percent of the Gaza Strip. Even before the war, the Gaza Strip was one of the most densely populated places in the world, with 2.3 million Palestinians – two-thirds of them refugees from areas conquered by Zionist forces in 1948 – concentrated in 141 square miles. Since October, two percent of Gaza’s population has been killed, and many more injured or gone missing. But nearly everyone has been displaced, many multiple times.

The Government Media Office in Gaza published a timeline demonstrating how Israeli evacuation orders beginning in November have forced Palestinians from the north of the territory to the south under the threat of death, pushing much of the population to a so-called humanitarian zone along the coast of southern Gaza. Since 16 August, the Israeli army has issued at least five evacuation orders directing Palestinians in central Gaza, primarily in the town of Deir al-Balah, to flee to an ever-shrinking area of the Gaza Strip.

On 25 August, patients, staff and displaced families inside and around the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah packed up what they could and fled.

A avaliação é que o Hamas já sofreu um golpe duro e que não possui mais capacidade de articulação militar em Gaza. Pelo menos não no mesmo nível que permitiu ao grupo terrorista realizar os ataques de 7 de Outubro.

Ukraine's forces counterattack with their own drones, aided by allies pledging a million drones. The result is a transformed battlefield where drones play a vital role.

instagram,"Swedish prosecutors said on Wednesday that they intend to charge two individuals with lighting fire to copies of the Qur'an in a series of instances last year that sparked indignation in the Muslim world and stoked worries of Islamist strikes, Reuters reported.

The two men committed ""offenses of agitation against an ethnic or national group"" four separate times by burning Islam's sacred book outside a mosque and in other public places, according to the Swedish Prosecution Authority.

Sweden's internal security service boosted its terrorism warning level in response to the burnings, while neighboring Denmark, which also saw a surge in Qur'an burnings, tightened its legislation to criminalize the practice.

instagram,"Watching the atrocities being committed on the land of Palestine and on Palestinians, my hands ended up penning down this piece of poetry, which entirely doesn't represent the pain and struggles of Palestinians but is an attempt to comprise a small part of their tale of oppression in the form of a poem. 
Their pain and struggle are known by the entire world, but we all remain helpless. Let's hope and pray for their lives to get better and for peace to finally embrace their land. 🇵🇸

-

On the land of olives, 
Somewhere in the old city its engraved, 
A nation led by the Prophet will not
surrender, 
The history echoes the torture of offenders.
From Alleys of Gaza to grounds of Jerusalem, 
Engulfs the mist filled with resilient squalls,
Tales of oppression moulds in mosaics of minarets and walls.
Even in the ruins of bustling cities,
The hope in people is not forsaken,
The faith in them remains unshaken.
Children inherit the trauma their mothers bore,
Flows the streams of sorrow till shore.
From the refugee camps to watermelon yards,
Threads weave the story of every soul scarred.
An Ice-cream truck to mortuary,
General newspaper to thousand obituaries. 
Hustling city to a rubble, 
Fashioning dreams to watching them crumble.
Abode of families to cemetery, 
Bombed the barren and residuary.
Missiles fall like rain pouring down, 
The smears of innocent blood cover the town.
Endured everything they stand steadfast,
Their hope for freedom and peace outlast.
May solace embrace their land,
Palestinians with courage withstand.

instagram,"Russia expressed skepticism towards Ukrainian President Zelensky’s invitation to a second summit aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed the need to define what constitutes a “peace summit” before considering participation, highlighting that the first summit did not meet these criteria. Zelensky’s invitation marks a shift from his prior stance, as Russia and China were excluded from the initial summit in Switzerland last month. Attended by over 90 states, the June 15 summit aimed to address the Ukraine conflict. The Kremlin criticized the exclusion of Russia, deeming such discussions “absurd.”

instagram,"According to a report from Reuters, emergency workers are trying to determine how many people are still missing after waters burst over a dam in eastern Sudan, causing the deadliest in a series of floods that have ravaged a country already torn apart by 500 days of war.

The collapse of the Arbaat Dam on Sunday killed 30 people and possibly killed scores more, the latest in a string of inundations around the country as this year's rainy season arrives sooner and heavier than in previous years.

War-shattered Sudan is already dealing with one of the world's worst starvation and displacement crises, and the floods have hampered assistance distribution, which has already been interrupted by the army's war with its adversary, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

A tragic event that significantly increased antisemitism on campuses in the US and Europe and may, sadly, prompt the end of Israel -  An incredibly frightening and despairing prospect.

The process / chronology of events:
1. Established state of Israel 1948 creating masses of Palestinian refugees
2. Occupation of Gaza and West Bank in 1967
3. The massacre/killing of Oct. 7, 2023, and without the context of occupation may be detrimental to the state of Israel
4. IDF Killing of 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza as of Aug., 2024, in response to Oct. 7
5. International protests against the mass killing of many thousands of Palestinian children and women, as witnessed on US University campuses
6. Failure worldwide to differentiate - lumping/confusing/equating anti-occupation with anti-zionism and anti-semitism (for example “From the river to the sea...”)
7. This may prove disastrous for Israel with the potential regretfully, to cause Jews to be expelled from Israel for the 3rd time.  #israelpalestineconflict #antisemitism  #middleeastpeace",0.0,0.0,,israelpalestineconflict,"Ofer Zur, Ph.D.",2024-08-26T22:54:52.000Z
instagram,"The explainer discusses the impact of Houthi attacks on global trade through the Red Sea, especially following their involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict that began on October 7th. The Red Sea is highlighted as a crucial global trade route, with significant geopolitical importance due to its connection to the Suez Canal and various strategic straits. 

The Houthi attacks have disrupted trade, particularly affecting shipping companies and various global industries, leading to increased freight costs and delayed shipments.

 Despite these disruptions, the energy sector remains largely unaffected, and the Houthis have not achieved their goal of enforcing a ceasefire in Gaza. 

The situation underscores the evolving geopolitical dynamics in the region, with major global powers involved and the potential for further escalation.

Because that is the most pleasant way for the Russia-Ukraine conflict to end peacefully through negotiations.

Efforts from major countries can partially contain the heat of the conflict.

But it would be better if the negotiation took place voluntarily on both sides.

The reason why the Ukrainian side, despite the losses they are facing, rejected negotiations on Russia's terms is because. 

Mr. Zelensky believes: The Ukrainian side has not yet tried to do everything possible to save the situation, and they will regret it if they surrender to Russia early while there is still a chance to regain territory, even if it is the smallest.

So, let him do what he wants.

From the first Swiss summit, to the second Ukrainian peace conference.

Mr. Zelensky can hold the summit many more times. But please be patient, let him try to do everything he can for Ukraine.

Give him a chance so he won't regret it later.

Give him time to realize that for himself. Only the path of negotiation on Russia's terms can bring peace to the two countries.

And only negotiations that take place voluntarily can completely resolve the conflict hidden deep in the hearts of both sides.

So, just let him do what he wants.

""The Russia-Ukraine conflict should not have happened. It would not have happened if Mr. Putin respected the US president.""

But ""respect"" between two great countries should come from both sides and maybe the Russians think differently.

As the media has announced, the Russia-Ukraine conflict comes from many different causes.

One of them is that while the US and Nato still recognize Russia - the Soviet Union as an opponent like during the Cold War, the risk of conflict is always lurking in Europe.

But fortunately, the war between Russia and Ukraine happened under President Putin
A person who is ""patriotic, strong and experienced in leadership"".

Russia will have more advantages to win and strengthen its own security.

instagram,"On March 6, Russia fired a missile into the Ukrainian port of Odesa that exploded about 400 metres (1,300ft) from where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was preparing to tour the city with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

“As we were getting into our cars, we heard a large explosion,” Mitsotakis later told reporters. “We were all concerned, especially if you consider that we were in an open space with no cover. It was quite savage.”

Many Western leaders have visited Zelenskyy, but this was the only occasion when there was a plausible threat to their life and safety. Analysts in Athens do not believe it was an accident.

“It was a message to Greece, a message to the Russophilic portion of Greek society,” said Konstantinos Filis, a professor of international relations who directs the Institute of Global Affairs at the American College of Greece.

That Russophilic population is dropping dramatically.

According to Dianeosis, an Athens-based think tank, about 70 percent of Greeks had a favourable view of Russia before the full-blown war in Ukraine. That fell to 50 percent after the 2022 invasion and to 30 percent last year.

instagram,"Moscow has promised to retaliate against Ukrainian attacks within its borders after a drone allegedly set fire to a warehouse storing munitions, leading to a state of emergency in Russia’s Voronezh region in the southwest. The incident occurred in a settlement within the Podgorensky district, according to Voronezh governor Aleksandr Gusev on Sunday. Ukrainian sources claim the warehouse was targeted because it supplied ammunition to Russian troops in Ukraine.

Gusev reported that several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected and destroyed by air defense forces overnight, causing a fire and explosions at the warehouse site. He didn’t specify the settlement but confirmed a state of emergency there. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, although two elderly women were hospitalized for precautionary checks.

Emergency services, military personnel, and officials are currently on-site working to contain the situation. Around 50 people from nearby villages have been evacuated to temporary shelters, where they are receiving necessary assistance.

In a significant move, Russia's internet and mass media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has directed Apple to remove 25 VPN apps from its App Store. This directive targets popular VPNs like NordVPN, Proton VPN, Red Shield VPN, and more, frequently used to access content deemed illegal in Russia. 🇷🇺🔒

This crackdown is part of a broader campaign that has intensified since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February 2022. VPNs, vital tools for internet freedom, are now being systematically restricted. Apple confirmed the directive to affected VPN vendors, emphasizing compliance with Russian laws.

Earlier this year, Apple faced a $13.7 million fine from Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service over market dominance issues. Despite these challenges, Apple's products have played crucial roles in the conflict, with Ukraine's Air Force using iPads for operating modern weapons in older jets.

THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT MAY BECOME A WAR WHERE ONE SIDE LIVES AND ONE SIDE DIES OR RUSSIA WILL HAVE TO ""DESTROY"" NATO IF RECONCILIATION PRESSURE COMING FROM THE US IS NOT ENOUGH.

During the past 2 years. The whole world hoped that one side would accept concessions so that the Russia-Ukraine conflict could end through negotiation.

But after all the efforts. We must accept the reality that: Russia will not accept defeat in this war and Ukraine will not accept territorial concessions either.

Therefore, the Russia-Ukraine conflict may become a war where one side dies and the other lives if the promises made by former US President Donald Trump after being elected for the second time are not fully implemented. Be mentally prepared for that.

Russia may be ready for a long war of attrition with Ukraine or have to ""destroy"" Nato - the alliance that is supporting Ukraine most strongly.

I'm not saying that Russia will destroy Nato by dropping an atomic bomb in the heart of Europe.

These are economic and political measures from Russia and its allies to reduce Nato's ability to support Ukraine.

For the Russians, anyway. An economic or political war would probably be more pleasant than having to destroy every last Ukrainian

Reporting from Tulkarem, Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said on Thursday that the raid was ongoing 12 hours later in the congested area, with sounds of explosives and gunfire heard and drones flying above.

“People inside the refugee camp say the Israeli army has set fire to some of the homes and that civil defence teams are not being allowed in to put out the fires,” she said.

The aerial attack on Thursday came as the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said fighters from its Tulkarem Battalion clashed with Israeli soldiers in the camp and detonated explosive devices targeting military vehicles.

“Our fighters continue to clash with the occupation forces and we have achieved direct hits among them,” the Qassam Brigades said.

The Israeli military deployed snipers on roofs and sent in bulldozers to destroy infrastructure.

The Quds News Network posted a video of a fire following the army’s ground assault on the camp.

On 25 August, the conflict intensified with Israel launching airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, while Hezbollah responded with a barrage of rocket attacks.

The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, expressed deep concern over the escalating violence, which endangers both Israeli and Lebanese civilians, and threatens regional stability. The UN has emphasised the need for both sides to cease hostilities and adhere to Resolution 1701, which calls for an end to the conflict.

instagram,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has concluded his Middle East trip without securing a deal to ease the Gaza blockade. Despite efforts to address the humanitarian crisis, no agreement was reached between Israel and Palestinian officials.

Blinken's trip aimed to strengthen ties with regional partners and address pressing issues, including the Gaza situation. However, the lack of progress on a deal highlights the complexity and challenges in achieving lasting solutions.

The Gaza blockade has led to severe economic and humanitarian conditions, exacerbating tensions in the region. Blinken's efforts will continue, but the immediate outcome falls short of expectations.

The US will likely maintain engagement with regional partners to explore alternative solutions and support initiatives promoting stability and peace in the Middle East.

I don't post these here often, as the internal political situation in Israel is too chaotic for most people to understand, let alone people that don't live here, and I get too much hate responses. But I keep going to these protests and documenting them, as the struggle to bring the Israeli hostages back to their family is a moral human obligation that is above all political affairs. It is not a matter of sides or party. It is not a matter of pro- or anti- or whatever. It is a basic demand to let innocent people out of captivity after 10 months. 
In the 4th photo meet Einav Zangauker, mother of 24 years old hostage Matan. Every Saturday she is there. Screaming. Fighting. You can tell she is barely sleeping. Going crazy without knowing anything about her son's medical and mental situation. And tens of thousands  Israelis surround her and the hostages families. Calling for an immediate hostage deal and ceasefire. For 324 agonizing days now.

instagram,"Hamas's rejection of the latest cease-fire proposal, despite mediation efforts from the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, highlights the deep political divides complicating peace efforts. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s new demands, including the exclusion of Hamas from Gaza’s future governance, are seen as obstacles to reaching a consensus. This impasse reflects the broader challenge of balancing domestic political pressures with international mediation efforts and underscores the difficulty of achieving lasting peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The ongoing violence and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by recent airstrikes and the failed cease-fire, continue to impact civilians severely. The rejection prolongs suffering and highlights the urgent need for effective humanitarian aid and conflict resolution strategies. The international community's focus on addressing immediate needs and negotiating peace remains critical amid the escalating humanitarian crisis.

The Corridor is a demilitarized buffer zone that stretches 14 kilometers (8.69 miles) along the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

The Yedioth Ahronoth daily said that ""no progress has been made in the talks on the Philadelphia Corridor.""

When the next round of axis discussions will take place is still unknown.

Citing an Israeli insider acquainted with the negotiations, the publication stated, ""We are talking about very critical hours.""

instagram,"Russia has suffered multiple diplomatic and judicial blows during the past week over its war on Ukraine, despite President Vladimir Putin’s high-profile visits to North Korea and Vietnam and Moscow’s claims that it is founding a “Eurasian security architecture that will replace the discredited Euro-Atlantic security arrangements”.

Putin signed a “comprehensive strategic treaty” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 19, incorporating what he said was a defensive alliance. South Korea’s government condemned the agreement. Its national security adviser, Chang Ho-jin, declared that Seoul would reconsider lifting a ban on arms supplies directly to Ukraine. Until now, South Korea has only sold weapons to Ukraine’s allies.

Chang later added that the type of weapons supplied to Ukraine would depend on Russia’s cooperation with North Korea. Putin said it would be a “grave mistake” if South Korea changed its policy of not supplying belligerents.

Russia also suffered judicial embarrassments. The International Criminal Court at The Hague issued arrest warrants on Tuesday for former Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Military Staff Valery Gerasimov, saying that they bore responsibility for attacks on Ukrainian electricity infrastructure. The court said, “There are reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects,” and that “the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”

instagram,"NATO allies selected Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as NATO’s next boss, as the war in Ukraine rages on its doorstep and uncertainty hangs over the United States’ future attitude to the transatlantic alliance.

Rutte’s appointment became a formality after his only rival for the post, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, announced last week that he had quit the race, having failed to gain traction.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg earlier said that the alliance had no plans to deploy forces to Ukraine, despite many of its members supplying Kyiv with weapons since Russia’s invasion.

“NATO has no plans to deploy forces to Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said during a visit to Finland, adding that the alliance was seeking “long term financial commitment to ensure that we stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes”.

“Over the last months, we have seen some gaps, some delays in the provision of military support to Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said, adding: “we need to ensure that that doesn’t happen again.”

The visit marked Stoltenberg’s first to Finland since the country joined NATO in April 2023, prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, thereby leaving decades of military non-alignment behind.

Stoltenberg’s visit came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday joined Western leaders in France to commemorate D-Day.

While there, Zelensky is due to meet US President Joe Biden for talks on how Ukraine can gain background after recent Russian advances.

Asked to comment on the risk of a Russian attack against a Nato member, Stoltenberg replied: “We don’t see an imminent military threat against any NATO ally.”

“This idea that there’s a kind of a countdown to the next war is wrong.”

You only need to act once to save someone in ""danger"" like Hamas. But it is very difficult to save someone who really ""wants to die"".

Because, even if you save them once, they will find a way to ""die"" many more times.

In short, there is almost no effective solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict until the balance of power in this world is changed.

Although the police have been instrumental in quelling the disturbance by deploying more officers and making hundreds of arrests, the criminal justice system as a whole, which includes courts and jails, is terribly unprepared to deal with the growing demand.

Law enforcement officials have been at the forefront of efforts to restore order since the riots broke out on July 30 as a result of a deadly knife assault and a subsequent wave of misinformation. Hundreds of arrests have been made in an effort to stem the violence.

instagram,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has issued arrest warrants for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and current military Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov. These charges are related to alleged crimes during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, particularly for their roles in directing missile strikes against Ukraine's electric infrastructure from October 10, 2022, to March 9, 2023. The court believes there are reasonable grounds to hold Shoigu and Gerasimov responsible for these actions, categorizing them as war crimes and crimes against humanity due to the targeting of civilians and civilian objects.

These charges add to the broader context of ICC actions against Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, who is already facing an ICC arrest warrant for the alleged forced relocation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Despite these charges, Russia, not being a full signatory to the ICC, typically does not extradite its citizens, raising doubts about whether Shoigu and Gerasimov will ever stand trial. Shoigu, who was recently dismissed from his role and reassigned to Russia's security council, and Gerasimov were among Putin's most senior defence officials, highlighting the high-level nature of these accusations.
Source: Reuters, AP

So what
While no doubt justified it is unlikely this move will do anything more than aggravate the Kremlin and restrict any movement by the two generals (something that was already highly unlikely). Additionally, this puts an end to rumours that Shoigu may defect following his removal as it is highly unlikely he would willing to go to a country that may end up selling him out to the ICC.

The civil defence spokesman in Gaza, Mahmoud Basal, said on Saturday that 15 people killed in the overnight attack were members of the al-Ejlah family, with three women among the dead. The total death toll from the attack was 16.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said three Israeli missiles hit the warehouse, located a few kilometres south of the Nuseirat refugee camp.

“A massive fire broke out, burning everything in the warehouse as children were torn to pieces. Rescue efforts are still continuing to try to recover more bodies,” he said.

“There is a great level of frustration and grief. The bodies are now being lined up at Al-Aqsa Hospital’s morgue as the family gets ready to bury them.”

The attack killed the family’s patriarch, Sami, along with his wife, mother and all of his children, according to Abdalhadi al-Ejlah, a cousin of the victims.

We further condemn the United States for providing Israel with the funding to carry out the attack, and Western states more generally for using their diplomatic muscle to protect Israel from condemnation. Genocide begins with the silence of the world.

“We are alarmed by the extreme, racist dehumanization of Palestinians in Israeli society, which has reached a fever-pitch. In Israel, politicians and pundits in The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post have called openly for genocide of Palestinians and right-wing Israelis are adopting Neo-Nazi insignia.

“Furthermore, we are disgusted and outraged by Elie Wiesel’s abuse of our history in these pages to justify the unjustifiable: Israel’s wholesale effort to destroy Gaza and the murder of more than 2,000 Palestinians, including many hundreds of children. Nothing can justify bombing UN shelters, homes, hospitals and universities. Nothing can justify depriving people of electricity and water.

“We must raise our collective voices and use our collective power to bring about an end to all forms of racism, including the ongoing genocide of Palestinian people. We call for an immediate end to the siege against and blockade of Gaza. We call for the full economic, cultural and academic boycott of Israel. “Never again” must mean NEVER AGAIN FOR ANYONE!”

The prisoners “have been exposed naked to the scorching sun while standing on sharp gravel stones, subjected to verbal abuse, and threatened with rape, death, and bombing, along with threats against their families”, it said in a statement on Tuesday.

The rights group said that recent testimony and evidence “reveal a level of violence that resounds with the atrocities documented in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib”, referring to the United States-run detention facility in Cuba and the prison in Iraq where US soldiers abused detainees.

Al Mezan said that the detainees have also been “deprived of food, water, sleep, and access to sanitation for extended periods, all while facing extremely harsh living conditions”.

The group estimated at least 2,650 Palestinians taken from the Gaza Strip after October 7 remain in Israeli custody, including 12 children and two women.

Among them, approximately 300 are facing trials, while 2,350 are classified as “unlawful combatants” without a defined detention period or specific charges.

instagram,"La Nato ha nominato il premier olandese Mark Rutte come prossimo Segretario generale. Rutte, 57 anni, assumerà l'incarico di capo della Nato il 1°ottobre, sostituendo il norvegese Jens Stoltenberg, che ha ricoperto la carica per dieci anni. Rutte: ""È un grande onore essere nominato Segretario Generale. L'Alleanza è e rimarrà la pietra angolare della nostra sicurezza collettiva"".

""Guidare questa organizzazione è una responsabilità che non prendo alla leggera. Sono grato a tutti gli alleati per aver riposto la loro fiducia in me. Sono ansioso di assumere l'incarico - ha detto - con grande vigore in ottobre, come successore di Jens Stoltenberg, che ha fornito alla Nato una leadership eccezionale negli ultimi 10 anni e per il quale ho sempre nutrito grande ammirazione"".

""So di lasciare la Nato in buone mani"", ha affermato l'attuale segretario generale dell'Alleanza atlantica, Jens Stoltenberg, commentando la ratifica della nomina di Mark Rutte a suo successore. ""Accolgo con grande favore la scelta di Rutte come mio successore degli alleati Nato. Mark è un vero 'transatlantista', un leader forte e un costruttore di consenso. Gli auguro di avere successo mentre continuiamo a rafforzare la Nato"", ha detto. ""So di lasciare la Nato in buone mani"".

 Il portavoce di Putin, Dmitri Peskov, ha dichiarato che la decisione di nominare Mark Rutte a capo della Nato ""difficilmente può cambiare qualcosa nella linea generale dell'Alleanza e dei suoi Stati membri"". ""Sia come Stati membri indipendenti sotto la guida diretta degli Stati Uniti sia insieme come Alleanza stanno lavorando per infliggere una sconfitta strategica alla Russia"", ha aggiunto Peskov, sottolineando che ""in questo momento la Nato è ostile"" a Mosca.

instagram,"What Happened: Since October 7, over 40,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed in Israeli attacks, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The situation remains dire, with many more people trapped under rubble and facing severe health risks. The humanitarian crisis has prompted urgent calls for a ceasefire.

What You Need to Know: The US and Israel have sent delegations to Qatar for renewed ceasefire talks, which resumed today. Hamas has expressed a willingness to meet with mediators after these discussions to assess whether Israel is genuinely committed to the proposed truce terms.

More: Jewish Voice for Peace, a US-based advocacy group, has reported that Israel has dropped more than 70,000 bombs on Gaza since October 7, based on UN satellite data. This significant escalation underscores the intensity of the conflict and the urgent need for a resolution to alleviate the suffering in Gaza.

every act of art becomes a courageous whisper of truth, 
rising from the ashes of the conflict.
And in those captured moments, 
lies the essence of survival.”

instagram,"On March 10, 2023, ten U.S.-based Christian groups published a letter directed to President Biden and Congress calling on the end of U.S. military aid to Israel. 

The letter reads: “In response to our Christian call to be peacemakers, we work with Palestinian and Israeli partners who live there as they struggle to realize a just and lasting peace. […] U.S. military funding to Israel in part sustains this violence, making the U.S. government complicit in ongoing abuses.”

instagram,"Memories of the good old days)
- I constantly work on being a better person each and every day. I analyze past mistakes and poor decisions made in order not to repeat them and to become the best version of myself possible. Life is to short to carry so much hate or resentment towards a specific group of people or society. One day we will all eventually face death and we won’t have the ability to change what it isn’t we aren’t proud of or what aspirations and opportunities we missed. That’s why it’s so important to enjoy the now and to appreciate all the gifts and relationships that life sends our way. Being a soldier means you place the welfare, safety, and freedoms of those you protect and serve. Society and life as we know it only exists  because of the selfless service and sacrifices of our men and women made defending it.

instagram,"A drone attack early this morning caused several oil storage tanks to catch fire near the town of Azov in Russia's southern Rostov region, which borders Ukraine. The governor of the Rostov region, Vasily Golubev, reported the incident on the Telegram messaging app, stating that oil product tanks were set ablaze due to the drone strike and that, according to preliminary data, there were no casualties. The Russian Emergencies Ministry released videos showing thick smoke and large flames emanating from the affected oil storage tanks. In response to the fire, approximately 200 firefighters and emergency personnel were deployed to the site to combat the blaze.

While Ukraine did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack, it has a history of conducting similar strikes. Kyiv has justified these actions by stating that such targets are legitimate, as they are used to fuel Russia's military operations during its invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing conflict has seen frequent use of drone technology to target infrastructure critical to the opposing side's military capabilities. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions and active conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides engaging in strategic strikes aimed at crippling each other's resources and military supply chains. The situation remains tense, with international observers closely monitoring the developments.
Source: Reuters, DW, EuroNews

So what
It is highly likely Kyiv is using these attacks as a way to slowly degrade Russia's ability to trade oil, thereby significantly damaging its money-making ability and directly hurting its war effort. This is due to the likelihood that the country's leadership understands that the West and other countries cannot or will not stop buying Russian oil, regardless of the situation, so their only remaining choice is to conduct attacks on this infrastructure directly. So far, this appears to be an effective strategy with Russian oil exports already falling dramatically.

instagram,"India on Sunday opted out of the Ukraine declaration adopted at the two-day Summit on #Peace in Ukraine, averring that only options acceptable to both parties can bring about abiding peace.

India, along with other #BRICS nations, decided not to join more than 70 other countries in supporting a resolution that characterises the ongoing conflict as a “war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine”.

Presenting India’s position, Pavan Kapoor, the secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, said: “In our view, only those options acceptable to both parties can lead to abiding peace. In line with this approach, we have decided to avoid association with a joint communique or any other document emerging from this summit.”

According to Kapoor, India thought it important to join the gathering that seeks to explore the way forward for a negotiated settlement to a complex and pressing issue. “India shares the global concern over the situation in Ukraine and supports any collective desire to facilitate peaceful resolution of the conflict. India’s participation in the Summit on Peace in Ukraine as well as in the preceding NSA political director-level meetings based on Ukraine’s peace formula is in line with our clear and consistent approach that enduring peace can be achieved only through dialogue and diplomacy,” he said.

The talks are set to begin next week, marking a significant step in Ukraine's bid to join the European bloc, a process initiated shortly after the Russian invasion in 2022.

The EU's decision to move forward with these discussions sends a powerful message to Russia, underscoring the bloc's steadfast support for Ukraine, both politically and financially. Additionally, the EU has approved a negotiating framework for Ukraine's neighbor, Moldova, further solidifying its commitment to strengthening ties with Eastern Europe.

""It is important that every country, every society that truly professes European values and aspires to real European strength — that every such nation — be together with all the others in a united Europe,"" Zelenskyy stated, highlighting the broader implications of Ukraine's potential membership.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has expressed willingness for security talks with the United States, provided that the conflict in Ukraine is a central topic. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov emphasized the necessity of dialogue between the U.S. and Russia to address numerous global security issues.

""This kind of dialogue is very much required because problems are piling up, and there are a lot of problems associated with the global security architecture,"" Peskov said during a briefing, in response to questions about potential discussions on nuclear risks separate from the Ukrainian conflict.

BARI, Italy, June 14 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven rich democracies have agreed to use proceeds from frozen Russian assets to give Ukraine $50 billion in loans, aiming to ensure Kyiv can continue its fight against Russia's invasion and to signal Western resolve to Moscow.
Leaders of the G7 - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - agreed to the plan on Thursday, along with top officials from the European Union, where most of the Russian assets frozen as a result of the war are held.

Este año se cumple el 70º aniversario de la Aviación del Ejército de la República Francesa. Aviation légère de l'armée de Terre, ALAT, lit.  La ""Aviación del Ejército Ligero"" se creó como una unidad separada el 22 de noviembre de 1954, cuando, después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, en Francia se entendió la necesidad de separar las unidades de aviación de la marina y el ejército de la Fuerza Aérea.

La creación de ALAT fue impulsada por la necesidad de aumentar la movilidad y eficacia de las fuerzas terrestres, especialmente dada la experiencia de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y las guerras en Indochina y Argelia.

Para su aniversario, ALAT presentó dos helicópteros con diseños especiales: Eurocopter Tiger y NH90 y compartió hermosas fotografías. Algunas de las fotografías (firmadas) fueron tomadas por el reconocido fotógrafo profesional de aviación Anthony Pecchi..

Unlike 2000, when Mr Putin made his maiden visit to the North-east Asian country, the 2024 visit saw a signing of a defence pact between the two countries. This means, if the US and its allies like Japan or South Korea take any adventurist step against the DPRK, it will also draw Russia into the conflict.
As the US is reviving the military ententes against Russia and China, along with its NATO and other allies, isn't it an appropriate step for Moscow to take affirmative steps by reviving its Soviet-era military alliances in a new and pragmatic format.

instagram,"In a significant move to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russian aggression and advance the country’s bid for NATO membership, U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a “historic” 10-year bilateral security agreement on Thursday.

The agreement, which was finalized on the sidelines of the G7 conference in Italy, aims to ensure continued U.S. support for Ukraine regardless of potential changes in American leadership, including the possibility of a Republican victory in the upcoming November election. The initiative seeks to cement long-term security ties and enhance Ukraine's defense capabilities amid ongoing conflict with Russia.

During a joint press conference, President Biden emphasized the importance of this agreement, stating, ""Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term."" He further directed a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, asserting, ""You cannot wait us out. You cannot divide us.""

In addition to the bilateral security agreement, the G7 countries collectively agreed to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan, financed by profits from frozen Russian assets. This financial support is intended to stabilize Ukraine’s economy and support its war efforts.

President Zelenskiy praised the security agreement as a pivotal moment for Ukraine, describing it as a framework for a sustained effort to modernize the country’s outdated armed forces and a significant step towards NATO membership. Despite long-standing aspirations, Ukraine has not yet been granted NATO membership, largely due to the alliance's stipulation that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all under its Article Five clause.

The agreement stipulates that in the event of an armed attack or credible threat against Ukraine, senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials will convene within 24 hours to discuss and coordinate an appropriate response.

.
🔺Por primera vez en dos años, las importaciones europeas de gas procedente de Rusia superaron a las de Estados Unidos.
.
Según el diario estadounidense Financial Times, las importaciones europeas de gas desde Rusia superaron en mayo a las de Estados Unidos por primera vez en dos años, a pesar de los esfuerzos de la región por deshacerse de los combustibles fósiles rusos desde la operación militar especial en Ucrania.
.
“Después de todos los esfuerzos que hemos hecho para aislar y comprometer nuestro suministro de energía, es sorprendente ver la cuota de mercado de gas y gas natural licuado (GNL) de Rusia en Europa”, declaró el director de energía de la consultora Conferencia Internacional sobre Sistemas de Información (ICIS, por sus siglas en inglés), con sede en Londres, Tom Marzec-Manser.
.
En este sentido, los informes del Financial revelaron que la situación evidencia el desafío de Europa de reducir aún más la dependencia del gas ruso, ya que varios países de Europa del Este, en particular, todavía dependen de las importaciones de sus vecinos.

instagram,"Pakistan is grappling with the decision to attend the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland on June 15-16. The summit, focusing on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine following Russia's invasion in 2022, presents a significant international engagement for Islamabad. However, Pakistan's participation remains uncertain due to its long-standing policy of non-alignment.

Spokesperson for Pakistan's Foreign Office, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, confirmed last week during a briefing that Pakistan had received an invitation to the summit. ""The invitation is under consideration,"" Baloch stated, highlighting the careful deliberation underway in Islamabad.

Sources in local media suggest that Pakistan might refrain from attending the summit to maintain its neutral stance. The absence of Russia from the summit, despite being a key player in the conflict, has also raised questions about the efficacy and impartiality of the gathering.

China, another influential player, has already decided to abstain from the summit, citing the exclusion of Russia as a significant flaw. Beijing's decision has been noted in Islamabad, which often aligns its foreign policy closely with that of China. Analysts believe that Pakistan's final decision may hinge on further diplomatic pressures from Western nations seeking broader participation from the Global South.

The backdrop to this summit and Pakistan's dilemma is rooted in the complex geopolitical landscape that emerged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the time, Pakistan's then-Prime Minister Imran Khan was visiting Moscow, a trip that, despite its coincidental timing, drew international scrutiny and criticism.

Since then, Pakistan has navigated a cautious diplomatic path, avoiding outright condemnation of Russia's actions while seeking to maintain balanced relations. This delicate balancing act was evident as Pakistan hosted the Ukrainian Foreign Minister and dispatched humanitarian aid, yet refrained from supporting U.S.-backed resolutions against Russia at the United Nations.

Russia launched 16 cruise missiles from land, sea and air as well as 13 attack drones, aiming at energy infrastructure in several regions, Ukraine's military said.

Air defences downed all but four of them, it added.

Russia's defence ministry said that its troops ""carried out a group strike with long-range high-precision weaponry from air and sea and also drones on Ukrainian energy facilities that power arms production"".

It said it also targeted warehouses containing munitions and ""air-launched weapons provided to the Ukrainian military by western countries"".

instagram,"RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA AGREE ON PARTNERSHIP

Vladimir Putin announced a “new level” of ties between Russia and North Korea during his visit to the reclusive state, pledging mutual support in the event of an attack. Thousands of North Koreans welcomed Putin, who signed a strategic partnership with Kim Jong Un, replacing previous agreements from 1961, 2000, and 2001.

The new pact covers political, trade, investment, cultural, and security aspects. Putin called it a “breakthrough document” and criticized US-led joint drills as “hostile” towards North Korea. Kim described the alliance as a “watershed moment” in their relations.

The visit included elaborate ceremonies, with Putin and Kim riding through Pyongyang in an open-top limousine. This highlighted North Korea’s reliance on Russia and signaled Putin’s influence despite Western opposition following his invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Accusations of North Korean arms supplies to Russia have been denied by both nations, though evidence suggests otherwise.

Putin’s visit, his first to North Korea in 24 years, aims to deepen their alignment amid shared animosity towards the West. Kim expressed strong support for Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The growing relationship has raised concerns in Seoul and Washington about potential military cooperation and technology transfers between the two countries.

During the visit, Putin presented Kim with gifts, including an Aurus car, while Russian state media emphasized their close rapport. This meeting follows Kim’s visit to Russia last year, which marked a significant step in their relations. Observers note the trend of increasing cooperation driven by shared grievances with the West, accelerated by the war in Ukraine.

In an interview on state radio, Orbán criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for not ruling out sending troops to Ukraine and expressed concern about a NATO proposal that would provide Kyiv with advanced long-range weapons capable of hitting Russian military bases. The Hungarian leader cautioned that these actions could escalate the conflict in Ukraine into a larger global conflict.

Viktor Orbán:
“War is a monster that is constantly hungry, it must be fed, and it must be fed with money. And I see that the Americans and the Democratic government of the United States, and the leaders of the European Union, are ready to feed it,”

instagram,"Russia launched a combined assault overnight, firing approximately 100 missiles and drones at various energy sites across Ukraine, Kyiv officials reported on Saturday.

This relentless barrage aimed at energy infrastructure has been a recurring tactic throughout the two-year conflict, causing substantial damage and energy shortages as Ukraine's air defenses struggle to fend off the onslaught of drones and missiles.

""""""The enemy launched 53 missiles of various types and 47 attack drones,"""" the air force said adding that they managed to intercept 35 of the missiles and all but one of the drones.""

Two thermal power plants sustained damage in the attack, as confirmed by the DTEK operator, although specific locations were not disclosed.

""Describing the assault as """"extremely difficult night,"""" the company, in a Telegram post, said, """"It was another extremely difficult night for the Ukrainian energy sector. The enemy struck two of our thermal power plants. The equipment was seriously damaged."""" This incident marked the sixth major attack on DTEK thermal power plants since mid-March.""

Ukraine's Energy Minister, German Galushchenko, revealed that Russia targeted sites in five regions: Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovograd, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Zaporizhzhia, spanning from the eastern frontlines to Ukraine's western border with the EU.

Speaking at a news conference in Vietnam's capital Hanoi that was live-streamed on the Kremlin website, Putin said he expected that the West would oppose his peace initiative on Ukraine.

The Russian president questioned why Russia's proposal was called ""unrealistic"" while no one criticized the same way Ukraine's ""ultimatum,"" containing conditions unacceptable for Moscow.

Sane politicians will think about Russia's proposal on Ukraine if they want to end the conflict, he said, warning that conditions may change depending on the situation on the battlefield.

instagram,"United States President Joe Biden has eased a ban on Ukraine using US weapons inside Russian territory to help the country defend its northeastern Kharkiv region from attack.

Several US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told multiple media outlets on Thursday that Kyiv would be allowed to use the weapons on the border of the Kharkiv region which came under renewed Russian attack earlier this month.

The US decision, which has predictably angered Kremlin officials, marks a policy shift by Biden who had refused to let Kyiv use US weapons beyond Ukraine’s borders, and comes as France and other European countries indicated Ukraine would be allowed to use their weapons on military targets inside Russia.

Kyiv will be authorised to strike military targets on the border with the Kharkiv region, where Russia has overrun a number of villages since May 10, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents.

“The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,” a US official told the Reuters, AFP and The Associated Press news agencies. The change was first reported by online media outlet Politico.

instagram,"‼️Nigel Farage, leader del partito Riforma del Regno Unito, ha affermato che l’espansione verso est della NATO e dell’Unione Europea ha provocato l’invasione russa dell’Ucraina. Farage, noto per le sue posizioni controverse e per essere stato spesso accusato di simpatizzare con Putin, ha dichiarato durante un’intervista alla BBC che l’Occidente ha fornito a Putin un pretesto per agire. Ha aggiunto che, sebbene condanni le azioni di Putin, ritiene che la reazione russa sia stata una risposta all’espansione occidentale.
Queste dichiarazioni hanno suscitato forti critiche da parte di esponenti di vari partiti politici britannici, che lo accusano di giustificare l’aggressione russa e di non sostenere adeguatamente il popolo ucraino. James Cleverly e Ben Wallace hanno denunciato le affermazioni di Farage come echi della propaganda russa, mentre John Healey ha dichiarato che tali commenti lo rendono inadatto a qualsiasi carica politica.

Farage ha inoltre discusso di Brexit, sostenendo che se fosse stato lui a guidare il paese fuori dall’Ue, una scelta avrebbe portato maggiori benefici economici. Ha criticato le politiche di “net zero” per aver contribuito alla deindustrializzazione della Gran Bretagna e ha difeso il mini-budget di Liz Truss come pro-crescita e pro-business.

🔹️Rishi #Sunak (#CON|Centro-destra): ""Le affermazioni di #Farage sono completamente sbagliate e fanno solo il gioco di #Putin. Queste affermazioni sono pericolose per la sicurezza della Gran Bretagna. Stiamo parlando di un uomo ha usato gas nervino per le strade della Gran Bretagna e sta stringendo accordi con paesi come la Corea del Nord"".

instagram,"Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted that the collective nuclear arsenals of Western nations cannot compete with Russia's own formidable stockpile. His remarks come amid heightened tensions between Russia and Western countries, particularly over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

According to international news sources, President Putin declared, ""Russia does not need nuclear weapons to achieve victory in Ukraine. The combined nuclear capabilities of Western nations are still no match for Russia’s."" This assertion underscores his confidence in Russia's military superiority despite global concerns about nuclear proliferation and security.

Meanwhile, American media reports indicate that the United States is reconsidering its nuclear strategy in response to perceived threats from Russia and China. The Biden administration is reportedly contemplating an increase in its nuclear arsenal, a significant shift from decades of disarmament efforts. This potential policy change is seen as a direct response to the evolving geopolitical landscape and the need to maintain strategic parity with major adversaries.

According to the reports, President Joe Biden has signed an executive order outlining the conditions under which the U.S. might deploy nuclear weapons. This move reflects a broader strategic reassessment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by Russia's and China's expanding military capabilities.
 
The escalating rhetoric and strategic maneuvers emphasize the growing tensions between global powers. Experts warn that such developments could lead to a renewed arms race, reminiscent of the Cold War era, with potentially dire consequences for international stability and security.

سعودی عرب کے سرکاری خبر رساں ادارے کے مطابق یوکرین کے صدر وولودیمیر زیلنسکی جدہ پہنچ گئے۔ قومی سلامتی کے مشیر اور یوکرین میں سعودی سفیر نے ان کا ایئرپورٹ پر استقبال کیا۔
بعد ازاں یوکرینی صدر شاہی محل پہنچے اور سعودی ولی عہد شہزادہ محمد بن سلمان سے ملاقات کی۔ دونوں رہنماؤں نے روس جنگ سے پیدا ہونے والی صورت حال پر تبادلہ خیال کیا۔
ملاقات میں زیلنسکی اور سعودی ولی عہد کی 3 ماہ قبل ہونے والی ملاقات میں امن منصوبے کو فروغ دینے اور جنگی قیدیوں کے تبادلے پر طے پانے والے امور پر عمل درآمد کا جائزہ بھی لیا گیا۔
خیال رہے کہ فروری 2022 میں روس نے یوکرین پر حملہ کر دیا تھا اور اس کے چار علاقوں پر قبضہ کرکے نام نہاد ریفرنڈم کرایا اور ان علاقوں کو روس میں ضم کرلیا۔
مغربی ممالک کی حمایت یوکرین کو حاصل ہونے کے باوجود 2 سال سے روس نے جنگ مسلط کر رکھی ہے اور دونوں جانب جانی اور مالی نقصان ہو رہا ہے۔
سعودی عرب کے بدستور روس اور یوکرین کے ساتھ تعلقات قائم ہیں۔ اس لیے وہ جنگ بندی میں ثالثی کا کردار بہتر طور پر نبھا سکتا ہے۔
سعودی عرب نے روس یوکرین جنگ پر ثالثی کا کردار ادا کرنے کی کوشش میں  گزشتہ برس اگست میں جنگ بندی مذاکرات کی میزبانی بھی کی تھی جس میں روس کے علاوہ 40 سے زائد ممالک کے نمائندوں نے شرکت کی تھی۔
یاد رہے کہ یوکرینی صدر وولودیمیر زیلنسکی نے مئی 2023 میں جدہ میں ہونے والی عرب لیگ کے سربراہی اجلاس میں بھی شرکت کی تھی۔

instagram,"In a decisive statement, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the urgent need for Germany to bolster its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to achieve full operational readiness before the decade's end. His comments come amid rising concerns over European security following Russia's extensive invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking during a session in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, Pistorius stressed the necessity for preparedness. ""We must be ready for war by 2029,"" he declared, underscoring the importance of deterrence to prevent potential conflicts. Pistorius highlighted that achieving this goal hinges on securing adequate finances, materials, and personnel.

""In an emergency, we need strong young women and men who can defend this country,"" he said, advocating for a new form of military service. He noted that this service model ""cannot be completely free of obligations,"" reflecting his belief in the essential role of conscription in national defense.

Pistorius, affiliated with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats, has tasked his ministry with exploring various models for reintroducing military conscription. Germany had suspended compulsory military service in 2011. Recent surveys, such as one conducted by research institute Forsa in March, indicate that about half of German citizens support its reinstatement.

Lollobrigida aveva detto che ""forse non era opportuno inserire questo tema a un G7 con il Papa"". In Puglia, a Borgo Egnazia, è arrivato anche Zelensky che ha affermato: ""Dal vertice un chiaro sostegno all'Ucraina"". Giorgia Meloni ha accolto i Grandi della Terra ed è intervenuta al primo tavolo su Africa e clima dicendo: ""L'Africa è un continente fondamentale per tutti noi, che ci chiede un approccio diverso da quello dimostrato in passato"". Fonti Ue fanno sapere che l'accordo sull'utilizzo dei profitti sugli asset congelati alla Russia è stato raggiunto a livello negoziale. L'intesa dovrebbe prevedere un fondo da 50 miliardi di dollari a sostegno di Kiev da sbloccare entro l'anno. Intanto, si apprende che, nel documento finale, la richiesta alla Cina di smettere di sostenere la guerra della Russia contro l'Ucraina e quella ad Hamas di accettare l'accordo per il cessate il fuoco a Gaza delineato dal presidente Joe Biden sarebbero i punti centrali. 

Joe Biden salta la cena che sarà offerta stasera dal presidente della Repubblica Sergio Mattarella al Castello Svevo di Brindisi per i capi di Stato e di governo del G7. Il presidente americano sarebbe affaticato per gli impegni che ha dovuto affrontare negli ultimi giorni. Biden è alla seconda trasferta europea in poco meno di una settimana.

Em encontro à margem da cúpula do G7 que ocorre na Itália, o Presidente Biden (EUA) e o Presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky assinaram, um acordo de segurança de 10 anos que compromete Washington a fornecer a Kiev uma ampla assistência militar. 

A medida é  uma tentativa de reforçar a Ucrânia na guerra contra a Rússia. Assim, o acordo busca comprometer as futuras administrações dos EUA a apoiar a Ucrânia, mesmo que o ex-presidente Donald Trump ganhe as eleições de novembro. Esse será um esforço de longo prazo dos Estados Unidos para ajudar a desenvolver as forças armadas da Ucrânia, que estão desesperadamente desarmadas e precisam de armas modernas.

🇾🇪 CONTEXT: Last week, Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi group targeted the United Arab Emirates via a drone strike in Abu Dhabi, killing three, injuring six and leading to massive blazes in oil tankers. 

❗️This triggered a series of air strikes on Yemen by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, of which UAE is a part. 

🥀 Fourteen people died in an air raid on the capital, Sanaa, and at least three children were killed in an attack on the port city of Hodeida. 

🥀 On Jan 21, an airstrike on a prison in the northern city of Saada, the rebels' home base, killed at least 87 people and wounded more than 100, overwhelming hospitals—though the coalition has denied responsibility for the prison attack. (Aid agencies on the ground like Doctors Without Borders have dismissed the denial.)

👉🏽WHAT NOW: Just today, two ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis were intercepted and destroyed over Abu Dhabi.

👉🏽The Houthis have warned of further attacks, while UAE issued a statement saying it is ""ready to deal with any threats"".

La Germania autorizza gli ucraini a difendersi “nel rispetto del diritto internazionale” contro gli attacchi che arrivano da immediatamente oltre confine. E questo “anche con le armi consegnate”, comprese quelle tedesche. Lo dice il portavoce del cancelliere Scholz, Steffen Hebestreit, in una nota.

🇺🇸Con una significativa inversione di rotta, ieri l'amministrazione Biden ha dichiarato per la prima volta che consentirà alle forze ucraine di effettuare attacchi limitati con armi fornite Usa all'interno della Russia, attorno all'area di Kharkiv. Tuttavia Washington ha posto un limite sul tipo di armi vietando l'utilizzo di Atacms o missili a lungo raggio in questo tipo di attacchi. Lo rivela un funzionario americano al Wall Street Journal. La decisione, spiegano le fonti, deriva dal tentativo del presidente di aiutare l'Ucraina a difendersi meglio, ma allo stesso tempo evitare un'escalation con Mosca.

रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन का साइबेरिया के अल्ताई माउंटेन पर एक मकान था. जो अब जल गया. आग कैसे लगी ये बात रहस्य है. लेकिन आरोप यूक्रेन पर लगाया जा रहा है. ये वही मकान है जहां पर पुतिन ने पूर्व इटैलियन प्रधानमंत्री सिल्वियो बर्लुस्कोनी की मेहमाननवाजी की थी. 

कहते हैं कि इस मकान में भी छिपने की गुप्त जगह है. यहां पर पुतिन मेडिसिनल बाथ लेते थे. इस पूरे कैंपस को आधिकारिक तौर पर Gazprom का स्वामित्व है. जो रूस में कई लग्जरी पैलेस का ख्याल रखता है. मकान के अंदर आग से कितना नुकसान हुआ है, इसका खुलासा तो नहीं हुआ लेकिन आग बेहद भयावह थी.
आग लगने की वजह भी नहीं पता चली है. लेकिन कुछ लोगों का मानना है कि ये काम यूक्रेन कर सकता है. क्योंकि रूस ने यूक्रेन में भारी तबाही मचा रखी है. सबसे पहले मकान के जलने की खबर ब्लॉगर Amyr Aitashev ने दी थी. रूस के सिरेना न्यूज ने आधिकारिक बयान लेने की कोशिश की लेकिन पुतिन की टीम से कोई जवाब नहीं आया.

ये जगह बेहद सुरक्षित है. यहां पर कोई आम रूसी नागरिक नहीं जा सकता. इसके चारों तरफ भारी सुरक्षा रहती है. इसके बावजूद पुतिन के मकान में आग लगना किसी के समझ में नहीं आ रहा है. इसी जगह पर पुतिन और उनके परिवार को सुरक्षित रखने के लिए हाई-टेक बंकर भी बनाया गया है, ताकि परमाणु युद्ध के दौरान वो सुरक्षित रह सकें. 

पुतिन का ये पैलेस अल्ताई रिपब्लिक के Ongudaysky जिले में है. इसके पास में ही मंगोलिया, चीन और कजाकिस्तान है. इस जगह और उसके आसपास कई वेंटिलेशन प्वाइंट्स हैं. इसके अलावा 110 किलोवोल्ट का अल्ट्रा-मॉडर्न सबसस्टेशन है. जो सिर्फ यहां बिजली सप्लाई करता है. बल्कि इससे पूरे कस्बे को रोशनी दी जा सकती है. जब ये पैलेस बन रहा था, तब बड़े-बड़े जर्मन एक्सेवेटर्स आए थे. यानी खुदाई करने वाली बड़ी मशीनें. यहां पर हिरणों का फार्म है.

instagram,"Major Development: Ukraine Gets Go-Ahead to Strike Back at Russia!

Today’s breaking news includes a big shift as Germany and France agreed that Ukraine can use Western-supplied weapons to target specific military sites inside Russia.

What influenced this decision?
-Russia's continued offensive in eastern Ukraine, particularly towards Kharkiv City. 

This move allows Ukraine to potentially strike back at launching points for attacks on Ukrainian soil.

What This Means:
-This is a major boost for Ukraine's defense capabilities.
-It raises concerns about potential escalation, though both countries emphasize targeting only military sites.

The international community now watches closely to see how Russia will respond to this development and whether it will alter the course of the war.

It can be said that this change highlights the evolving dynamics of the conflict and underscores the critical support Ukraine continues to receive from Western allies.

While I hope it strengthens Ukraine's defense, I'm also cautious about the potential for escalation. What are your thoughts? Let's discuss this in the comments!

instagram,"According to US officials, President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets in Russia, specifically in the Kharkiv region.

The officials stated that their directive is to ensure that Ukraine can utilize US weapons for “counter-fire purposes” in order to retaliate against Russian forces that are attacking or preparing to attack them.

In recent weeks, Russian forces have made advancements in the Kharkiv region following an unexpected offensive in the vicinity, near the Russian border.

Ukrainian officials reported on Friday that three individuals were killed and 16 injured when a residential building in a suburb of Kharkiv city was hit by Russian shelling.

“Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of Army Tactical Missile System [ATACMS] or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,” The officials stated.

When questioned about whether the new policy involved engaging Russian aircraft, an official responded: “We’ve never told them [Ukraine] they can’t shoot down a Russian airplane over Russian soil that’s coming to attack them”.

The White House and state department did not provide an immediate comment.

Earlier, the UK indicated that it was willing to ease restrictions on how Ukraine could utilize weapons provided by the West.

Despite concerns about potential escalation of the conflict, several European leaders have recently advocated for relaxing restrictions on the use of such weapons.

However, Washington, which is the main supplier of Ukraine’s weaponry, has been reluctant to ease these restrictions due to fears of escalation.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested this change during his visit to Moldova on Wednesday.

He said that: “At every step along the way, we’ve adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that’s exactly what we’ll do going forward”.

Analysts suggest that Russia’s strategy was to strike ahead of the anticipated US aid to Ukraine, aiming to gain an advantage before the additional support could bolster Ukrainian defenses. However, the offensive’s early start and limited troop numbers have raised questions about its potential effectiveness. 🌍❗

Military experts are closely monitoring the situation, noting that the premature timing and insufficient manpower might undermine Russia‘s efforts on the battlefield. The geopolitical stakes are high, and this move signals a critical phase in the ongoing conflict. 🕊️🔍

Weapons Sales (SIPRI TIV Million)(December 2022)

In a more fractured world, we're seeing more conflicts. These conflicts are often fought with weapons traded between countries. This dataset shows the weapons sales by country in December 2022. The unit, SIPRI TIV Million, is used to measure the volume of sales of weapons, not the price. If used by another force, these weapons are valued at 40% of TIV and weapons that have been refurbished or modified are valued at 66% of TIV. TIV refers to trend-indicator value and reflects military capability, not financial value. As we can see, the United States is leaps and bounds clear of anybody else, likely due to aid to Ukraine. France, Russia, China, Italy, Germany, the UK, Spain, Israel, and Poland make up the 2nd to 10th position.

instagram,"#razaremarks - Is War Just Business?
The war in Ukraine has caused immense suffering, but it’s also been profitable for the arms industry in the US and other Western countries. Some argue that these arms sales are necessary to support Ukraine, but others question the ethics of profiting from war. This raises a critical question: should profits outweigh the human cost of war? Head to the link in our bio to read the whole article!

instagram,"Russia has moved aggressively to block Ukraine’s grain exports, aiming to crush both a critical economic sector and source of national pride. But Ukrainians have found ways to keep their crucial food supplies flowing as they enter the third year of Europe’s largest war in eight decades.

As the conflict continues, Russia has targeted Ukrainian grain and port facilities with air strikes, a potential war crime. The ports supplied staple goods to people around the world and anchored Ukraine’s economy. But a Russian blockade has changed the calculus.

Naval victories and innovative export routes have allowed Ukraine to keep its grain moving. After the collapse of the Black Sea grain deal, policymakers feared prices would again soar and potentially leave millions hungry. However, the worst was avoided due to a series of new export corridors that have kept the grain flowing.

instagram,"President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday that while the US has authorized Ukraine to strike targets inside Russian territory using Western-supplied weapons, these strikes are restricted to areas near the Ukraine-Russia border and not deep into Russian territory or Moscow. 

This policy adjustment aims to enable Ukraine to defend its northeastern region, particularly Kharkiv, which has been under severe Russian bombardment. 

Germany has also permitted Ukraine to use German-delivered weapons for similar defensive strikes. 

Biden emphasized that the weapons are intended to counter attacks on Ukraine from Russian positions near the border. 

He made these remarks while attending the 80th anniversary of D-Day in France.

Looking at what is actually happening:

Russia's plan to annex some Ukrainian territories is to solve the geopolitical problem for Russia when the Ukrainian people have leaned towards the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Therefore, the strategy of the Ukrainian-Zelensky president mainly affects the financial situation and loss of life of the Ukrainian side.

President Zelensky can still be said to have tried his best if he can help Ukraine end the conflict with minimal damage.

instagram,"The United States has announced a new $275 million military aid package for Ukraine to help defend against Russia’s assault on Kharkiv. This aid includes ammunition for HIMARS, artillery rounds, missiles, anti-armor systems, and precision aerial munitions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the importance of quickly delivering this aid to support Ukraine's military efforts.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently visited Kharkiv, reporting progress in regaining control of northern border areas. In contrast, Russian officials claim control over parts of Vovchansk, illustrating the ongoing conflict.

Russia's intensified attacks on Kharkiv have prompted the evacuation of children and over 11,000 residents since May 10. The destruction of the train network further strains Ukraine’s defenses. President Zelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from Western allies, highlighting the urgency of additional support.

instagram,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is pushing partners to get more directly involved in the war by helping to intercept Russian missiles and allowing his country to use Western weapons against military equipment amassing near the border.

“It’s a question of will, but everyone says a word that sounds the same in every language: everyone is scared of escalation,” the 46-year-old leader told the Reuters news agency in Kyiv on Monday.

“Everyone has gotten used to the fact that Ukrainians are dying – that’s not escalation for people,” he said.

Zelenskyy proposed that the armed forces of neighbouring NATO countries could intercept incoming Russian missiles over Ukrainian territory to help Ukraine protect itself.

Russia has fired thousands of missiles and drones at Ukraine since the start of its invasion in 2022 and launched an assault in the northeastern border region of Kharkiv on May 10 that resulted in their biggest territorial gains in a year and a half.

“Russians are using 300 planes on the territory of Ukraine. We need at least 120-130 planes to resist in the sky,” Zelenskyy said, again calling on Western allies to supply with additional air defence systems. Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of US-designed F-16 fighter jets.

instagram,"Hi, I’m Sharon Gill, and I’m the author of this book “war time wound care for anyone. I’ve dedicated my life to healing. My medical education provided me with knowledge to learn the devastating impact of war firsthand. The wounds—both physical and emotional—leave scars that extend far beyond the battlefield.

Why did I write this book on wound care? Because I believe knowledge can be a beacon of hope. By sharing practical, life-saving techniques, I hope to empower those caught in the crossfire. Whether it’s a child in Gaza or a soldier in Russia, understanding wound care can mean the difference between life and death.

My mission extends beyond bandages and sutures. I envision a world where healthcare bridges divides, where compassion transcends borders. This book isn’t just about stopping bleeding; it’s about stitching together fractured communities. It’s about turning trauma into resilience.

The hard copies of this book will find their way to war-torn regions. From Gaza to Rafah, Israel to Poland, language won’t be a barrier. Every page carries the promise of healing. And soon, it’ll be available on Amazon, reaching even more hands.

Why? Because I believe in education as a force for peace. When we understand how to care for one another, we build bridges. When children read these words, they might dream of becoming doctors, nurses, or scientists—the healers of tomorrow.

So, let’s turn the page together. Let’s transform knowledge into action, wounds into scars, and chaos into harmony. I’m thrilled to be an author of this book, sharing my perspective and expertise with women, children, and anyone who believes in the power of healing. 🌟

These are a few pages of my book, the full published book will be available for purchase if you live in US, CANADA, UK & AUSTRALIA & FREE OF COST FOR ANYONE FROM ANY OTHER COUNTRY BESIDES THE ONES MENTIONED. 
.
Thank you for your support. I aim to make peace 🕊️

instagram,"Russian forces have started the first stage of exercises ordered by President Vladimir Putin to simulate preparation for the launch of tactical nuclear weapons, the Defence Ministry said on Tuesday.

Moscow has linked the exercises to what it calls “militant statements” by Western officials, including French President Emmanuel Macron, which it said created security threats for Russia.

Nuclear analysts say the exercises are designed as a warning signal by Putin to deter the West from wading more deeply into the war in Ukraine. Western countries have provided weapons and intelligence to Kyiv but have refrained from sending troops.

The Defence Ministry said the first stage of the exercise involved Iskander and Kinzhal missiles.

It is aimed at ensuring that units and equipment are ready for “the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons to respond and unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation”, the ministry said.

The drills involve missile forces in Russia’s Southern Military District, which lies adjacent to Ukraine and also includes parts of Ukraine that Russia now controls.

Belarus, where Russia said last year it was deploying tactical nuclear weapons, will also be involved, the two countries have said.

Tactical, or non-strategic, nuclear weapons are less powerful than the strategic arms designed to wipe out whole enemy cities, but they nevertheless have vast destructive potential.

Some Western analysts believe non-strategic nuclear weapons have acquired greater importance in Moscow’s thinking since the start of the war in Ukraine, where its conventional forces struggled in the first two years.

In theory the use of such a weapon could deliver a stunning shock to the West without necessarily triggering a full-blown nuclear war, though the risk of triggering a cycle of escalation would be huge.

instagram,"New Zealand's Defence Minister, Judith Collins, has announced a notable reduction in the nation's defense budget, proposing a cut of 6.6%. This decision arises amidst ongoing challenges related to personnel and equipment within the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). According to the Defence Minister's office, the current budgetary reduction aims to address these critical issues by reallocating resources and ensuring better financial management.

The government's conservative administration is responsible for this budgetary adjustment. Despite the reduction, the government has also allocated a substantial sum of $571 million to the defense sector. This funding aims to address pay raises for Defence Force personnel and invest in various projects and equipment upgrades.

Despite the proposed cuts, the government has simultaneously committed to a substantial investment of $571 million to bolster the NZDF. Announced on May 10, 2024, this funding is specifically targeted towards improving pay for Defence Force personnel and upgrading critical equipment and infrastructure. The Defence Minister emphasized that this allocation is intended to enhance the operational readiness and welfare of the NZDF, even as the overall budget sees a reduction.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a close, according to reports from Reuters. Putin is ready to agree to a ceasefire that acknowledges the current positions of both sides on the battlefield.

A senior Russian source, familiar with high-level discussions within the Kremlin, revealed to Reuters that while Putin is capable of continuing the fight indefinitely, he is open to freezing the conflict with a ceasefire. ""Putin can fight for as long as it takes, but he is also ready for a ceasefire—to freeze the war,"" the source said.

Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, reiterated that the Russian President has consistently advocated for dialogue as a means to end the war. Peskov emphasized that Russia does not desire a perpetual conflict.

The war, which began on February 24, 2022, remains ongoing as of today, May 24, 2024.

instagram,"Russia’s offensive in Ukraine’s northeastern border region of Kharkiv may just be the “first wave” in a wider assault, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned as he appealed to allies to send more air defence and fighter jets.

Russian forces, which had made only moderate advances in recent months, launched a surprise assault in the Kharkiv region on May 10 that resulted in their biggest territorial gains in a year and a half.

Zelenskyy conceded on Friday, in an interview with the AFP news agency, that Ukraine only has a quarter of the air defences it needs to hold the front line while the war grinds on.

He said Russian forces managed to advance between five to 10km (3-6 miles) along the northeastern border before being stopped by Ukrainian forces.

On Saturday, Kharkiv’s Governor Oleg Synegubov said “a total of 9,907 people have been evacuated” from the region following a ground attack by Russian troops.

Al Jazeera’s John Holman, reporting from Kharkiv, said that at present Ukraine is “outmanned in terms of soldiers” in parts of the front line even before the latest Russian attacks.

instagram,"1. UKRAINA ""IS LOST"" AND THE PATH OF DESTINY.
What is preventing peace between Russia and Ukraine?

Is it pressure from the US and the West or are the terms offered by Russia unreasonable?

Yes. All of them can be causes.

But I think, from a deeper perspective. Ukraine's real problem lies mainly in one thing.

2. UKRAINA “IS LOST”
Ukrainians, they have lost their way.

Because they were lost, they were unable to see the path to their own destiny.

Because they were lost, they did not separate the issues between Russia-US, Russia-Nato, Russia-Ukraine.

Because of losing its way, Ukraine has become the ""representative"" of the US and Nato on the battlefield against Russia.

3. PARADISE LOST
There will be a lot of damage to both after this conflict. But it is not too late to rebuild a country.

Ukrainians have enough capacity to make their country beautiful again

But first, the most important thing - they must see the path of their own destiny.

Yes! Ukraine's path to destiny is neutrality, with autonomy and national pride as the foundation.

4. NEW UKRAINE
Before the conflict, they were a Ukraine filled with many disputes with Russia. But after the conflict, it must be a Ukraine with a completely new mindset.

Ukraine can aim to become a center for research, production, export, entertainment... a partner of many countries and economic blocs.

Also, with my ""experience"". Ukraine can be a member to mediate disputes by peaceful means, contributing to stabilizing regional security and enhancing its reputation internationally.

By this time, Ukraine's fateful path had been clearly outlined. Therefore, the Russia-Ukraine conflict should stop here.

Two children are among those killed, the ministry claimed.

According to the Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, a part of a 10-story apartment building collapsed there earlier in the day.

Gladkov also claimed that the building was hit by a Ukrainian projectile during an air raid alert in the oblast.

Russian air defenses allegedly shot down six Tochka-U missiles and six rockets over Belgorod Oblast, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The ministry claimed that the residential building was ""damaged"" by a Tochka-U missile fragment.

Ukrainian officials did not comment on the claims. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports.
Claims of rocket or drone attacks against Belgorod Oblast, which borders Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts, have become a common occurrence in recent months. #belgorod #russia #belgorodrussia #putin #militar #military #militaire #russia #ruso #rusa #nuke #guerre #guerra #ukraineinvasion #russianinvasion #ukrainerussia #ukrainerussiaconflict #russiaukraine #russiaukrainewar #russiaukraineconflict #ukrainerussiawar #russian #RussianUkrainianWar #war #vladimirputin #Украина #乌克兰 #乌克兰美女 #乌克兰最新消息 #乌克兰今日 #russie",0.0,0.0,,russiaukraineconflict,,2024-05-13T16:24:24.000Z

End the conflict.

""The Russia-Ukraine conflict will end like that, as calmly as an ending party.""

Because according to my personal observation, the conflict is gradually entering a stable trajectory.

The details seem to direct the conflict into the final chapters so it can end peacefully.

Based on what do I say that?

As you know, over the past 2 years, the Ukrainian side has fiercely resisted Russia's attacks.

At the same time, continuously strengthen forces, provide military training, and organize counterattack campaigns into Russian territory.

Or most recently, the terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall theater aimed at dividing Russia is believed to be related to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the US and Western countries tried hard to interfere in the Russian election.

  At the same time as they strive to provide aid to Kiev, call for sanctions, and confiscate Russian assets almost as much as possible, they are anti-Russian to the point of self-destruction.

There are times when it seems like Russia is fighting against the whole world.

But then what happened? Nothing. Russia is still there. Russian troops continue to advance deeper and deeper into Ukrainian territory.

In short, over the past two years, everything Ukraine and its allies could do, they have done.

But the situation is still irreversible. The Russian side continues to dominate.

As long as Russia can maintain its current minimum performance, the end of the conflict will come in the near future.

It's like a party.

When all parties involved are hungry, they will try to eat as enthusiastically as possible.

  But no matter how delicious it is, there will come a time when they all feel full and start to get bored.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict will also end like that, as calmly as an ending party.

instagram,"यह युग युद्ध का नहीं है, फिर भी रूस यूक्रेन युद्ध को पूरा एक साल हो गया, लेकिन अभी तक हार-जीत का फैसला नहीं हो पाया है। हार-जीत तो दूर, यह भी तय कर पाना मुश्किल है कि जंग में पलड़ा किसका भारी है—सुपरपावर रूस का या अमेरिका और इंग्लैंड जैसे देशों की मदद ले रहे यूक्रेन का? दोनों देश लड़ाई को लेकर रोजाना अपने-अपने दावे जरूर पेश करते रहते हैं। प्रतिदिन दोनों देशों की सेनाएँ, राष्ट्राध्यक्ष और विदेशी खुफिया एजेंसियाँ आँकड़े एवं विश्लेषण जारी करती हैं, फिर भी लगता है कि सब सच्चाई से कोसों दूर हैं।

ऐसे में पूरी दुनिया हैरान है कि आखिर युद्ध के मैदान में चल क्या रहा है! दरअसल, यह युद्ध जितना मैदान में लड़ा जा रहा है, उससे कहीं ज्यादा भीषण तरीके से इन्फॉर्मेशन स्पेस में लड़ा जा रहा है, यानी इंफो वॉरफेयर, जिसके चलते यह पता करना बेहद मुश्किल हो रहा है कि युद्ध में आखिर चल क्या रहा है। युद्ध को कवर करनेवाले पत्रकार भी इस खेल को नहीं समझ पा रहे हैं।

किसी भी युद्ध को कवर करने के लिए किसी पत्रकार को सेनाओं के साथ एंबेडेड होने की क्या मजबूरी होती है, उस पर भी कुछ सामग्री इस पुस्तक में है। क्योंकि बिना एंबेडेड जर्नलिज्म के युद्ध की कवरेज करना मुश्किल होता है। लेकिन उस तरह की पत्रकारिता की क्या कमियाँ हो सकती हैं और उसे कैसे सुधारा जा सकता है, उसके बारे में थोड़ा बताने और समझाने का प्रयास इस पुस्तक के माध्यम से किया गया है।

Bliss Farm Integrated runs a farm to table service, in Ibadan, where, employing traceability and food entertainment, consumers are given unique experience with products farmed fresh and cooked for retail in a fun ambience and the consumers carried along in the journey.

Oyeleke would be sharing valuable insights on ensuring a sustainable agribusiness in a chaotic business environment of today.

Food and agricultural businesses have been one of the most impacted ventures by and left with lasting effects of ravaging macroeconomic events of the last few years.

At least 50% of the nation’s poultry farms has shutdown to this.

This is similar event in the quick service restaurant sector (QSR) losing more than half of its over ₦250 billion worth.

The Bliss Farm integrated operates in both the food and agribusiness sector and has witnessed and been impacted by these macroeconomic occurences. 

It farms and was affected by input supply chain disruption of Russia-Ukraine conflict and covid pandemic and also low patronage from lockdown and movement restriction of the latter. It also was battered by dwindled purchasing power to cash crunch, inflation and recession.

Despite facing all these, Bliss Farm stood tall weathering these challenges and growing bigger even establishing multiple branches across Ibadan.

This is to the prowess of Oluwakayode in thinking ahead and evolving formidable strategy -that encompasses cost effectiveness, business pivoting and product development, and effective operational and strategic managements. 

It why when I thought of this topic Oyeleke and his company were the perfect match. 

You want to anticipate this podcast and listen to it as it promises potent insights that would help with sustainably managing and scaling your agribusiness.

The congressional notification came in accordance with the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW).

Chloropicrin was first used as a weapon during World War I.

instagram,"The counteroffensive last year fell short, resulting in Russia's significant recapture of Avdiivka. President Zelensky has acknowledged this new military reality, and the Biden Administration’s strategy now aims to sustain Ukraine's defense until after the U.S. presidential elections, hoping to exhaust Russian forces in a prolonged war of attrition. However, this approach has significant implications and potential flaws not fully addressed in public discourse.

The critical implication of this strategy is the indefinite loss of territories currently occupied by Russia. Russia is unlikely to relinquish these lands at the negotiating table. While Ukraine should not formally surrender these territories, their status may need to be deferred for future talks, akin to the Cyprus situation, where negotiations have persisted for decades without resolution or renewed conflict.

The Biden Administration must also align American public opinion with this reality. Supporters of a complete Ukrainian victory may hold overly optimistic views, such as the notion of driving Russia out of Crimea through missile bombardment—a strategy deemed impractical given Ukraine’s limited amphibious capabilities.

A more realistic scenario involves Ukraine inflicting significant losses on Russian forces while on the defensive, potentially enabling a successful counterattack in 2025. However, this relies on continuous Western weapon supplies and favorable battlefield conditions, which are uncertain.

The Biden Administration should test Putin’s readiness for peace talks, which would require painful concessions from Ukraine and the West. Nonetheless, these concessions are more emotional than practical and are preferable to prolonged conflict and potential Ukrainian defeat. Recognizing the lost territories and focusing on Ukraine's current borders could pave the way for a feasible peace settlement and prevent further devastation. #talkdiplomacy #upsc #css #cuet #UkraineWar

instagram,"A recent report from a U.N. sanctions committee has revealed that a North Korean-made Hwasong-11 series ballistic missile was responsible for striking Kharkiv on January 2. Both Ukrainian and U.S. officials have previously alleged Russia’s utilization of North Korean-produced missiles in attacks on Ukraine. The report further suggests that Russia’s acquisition of these missiles violates U.N. sanctions, raising concerns about Moscow’s military cooperation with Pyongyang.

Inspectors conducting a field investigation in Kharkiv found fragments from the missile that indicate its North Korean origin. Notably, the report emphasizes the absence of evidence linking the missile to Russian manufacturing. As Russia’s top weapons supplier, North Korea’s provision of advanced military equipment to Moscow underscores growing apprehensions about the extent of collaboration between the two nations and its potential implications for regional security dynamics.

These measures, targeting both Russian and non-Russian organizations, aim to cripple Russia's military and industrial capabilities. Among the targeted entities are 20 firms based in China and Hong Kong, reflecting concerns about growing military cooperation between China and Russia. The US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasized that these sanctions would disrupt Russia's war efforts and support Ukraine's resistance. The Russian and Chinese embassies in Washington, DC, have yet to respond to these actions. Additionally, the US Department of State accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention by using chloropicrin, a choking agent. Such actions highlight the international community's condemnation of Russia's aggressive tactics in the ongoing conflict.

Tikaram Pokharel, spokesperson for the commission, emphasized the necessity for diplomatic efforts to facilitate the rescue of affected Nepalis and ensure prompt medical treatment for the injured.

In a formal statement, Pokharel stressed the urgency of repatriating the bodies of Nepalis who lost their lives in the conflict. The NHRC also underscored the critical importance of intervening to safeguard the lives of individuals such as Kritu Bhandari, who have been staging a hunger strike in Kathmandu for 17 days, demanding the rescue of fellow Nepalis.

The NHRC's field inspection team reported a concerning deterioration in the health conditions of those participating in the hunger strike on a daily basis.

روسیه می‌‏گوید ۱۶ موشک و ۳۱ پهپاد پرتاب شده ازسوی اوکراین را سرنگون کرده است

وزارت دفاع روسیه روز دوشنبه ۱۳مه، اعلام کرد که سامانه‌های دفاع هوایی این کشور ۱۶ موشک و ۳۱ پهپاد را که اوکراین در شبانه‌روز گذشته به خاک روسیه پرتاب کرده بود، منهدم کرده است.

رویترز به نقل از روسیه نوشته است که روز یکشنبه، ۱۵ نفر در بلگورود بر اثر اصابت قطعات یک موشک متعلق به دوران شوروی که توسط اوکراین پرتاب و توسط نیروهای روسی سرنگون شد، در شهر بلگورود در نزدیکی مرز اوکراین کشته شدند.

وزارت دفاع روسیه روز دوشنبه اعلام کرد که ۱۲ موشک هدایت شونده از یک راکت انداز چندگانه اوکراینی پرتاب شده است.

این وزارتخانه همچنین گفت که چهار فروند موشک و هفت پهپاد بر فراز کریمه سرنگون شدند. همچنین هشت پهپاد بر فراز منطقه کورسک و چهار فروند پهپاد بر فراز منطقه لیپتسک منهدم شدند.

ایگور آرتامونوف، فرماندار منطقه  کورسک در جنوب روسیه در تلگرام نوشت: «یک پهپاد باعث آتش سوزی کوتاه مدت در یک پست برق در منطقه کورسک شد.

آرتامونوف گفت: «این حادثه تلفات جانی نداشته است. آتش سوزی در محدوده پست برق در حال خاموش شدن است.»

هیچ اظهار نظر فوری از سوی اوکراین وجود نداشته است. کی‌یف می‌گوید که هدف قرار دادن زیرساخت های نظامی، حمل و نقل و انرژی روسیه، تلاش‌های جنگی مسکو را تضعیف می‌کند و پاسخی به حملات مرگبار بی شمار روسیه است.

instagram,"KYIV ­— Ukraine’s security service said Tuesday it had foiled a plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky by undercover Ukrainian security officials who were working for Russia.

Two unnamed colonels from the Ukrainian State Security Department, the SBU , the main organization protecting top officials including Zelensky, were part of a group of covert agents helping Russia’s security service, the FSB, to plot the assassination, Kyiv said.

The colonels were arrested and Kyiv said the conspiracy included plans to also murder SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk and Military Intelligence boss Kyrylo Budanov.Zelensky has previously said he has survived more than 10 assassination attempts. “But it is the first time such a high-ranking official of the state security department has become the enemy’s moles,- Artem Dehtiarenko, SBU spokesman.

One of the tasks of the FSB intelligence network was to search for executors among the military close to the protection of the president, who could first take him hostage and later kill him,”- the SBU press service said in a statement.

Besides Zelensky, a group of FSB agents including the defector colonels were planning to assassinate spymaster Budanov, Kyiv said.

instagram,"Following his criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt and his family were forced to flee Russia, fearing their immediate arrest. Goldschmidt has since been labeled a “Foreign Agent” by Russia, becoming the first religious leader in Russia to be named as such, a title he carries with distinction. 

Today, Rabbi Goldschmidt serves as the President of the Conference of European Rabbis, an umbrella organization which advocates on behalf of Jewish communities across Europe. For his work, he is being presented with the 2024 Charlemagne Prize, awarded for work done in the service of European unification. 

Rabbi Goldschmidt  believes that the Kremlin is one of the key players fomenting dissent on college campuses across the US.. He believes hatred towards Jews on campuses should be confronted and communities in Europe are combating similar challenges.  He also believesAmerica and Western democracies should align themselves with Ukraine and Israel.

The inauguration at the Grand Kremlin Palace was boycotted by the United States, United Kingdom, and several European Union countries amid ongoing tensions over Russia’s war in Ukraine. In his speech, Putin emphasized national unity and resilience, stating that the country would overcome obstacles and emerge victorious. Critics questioned the legitimacy of the election and the conduct of Putin's rule, citing issues such as the death of political rival Alexey Navalny and the crackdown on opposition.

instagram,"“La nostra posizione non cambia: abbiamo sempre detto che l’Ucraina andava aiutata in ogni modo possibile, e lo stiamo facendo, ma abbiamo anche sempre escluso un intervento diretto nel conflitto dei nostri militari''. Lo dice in un'intervista al 'Corriere della Sera' il ministro della Difesa Guido Crosetto. ''A differenza di altri, noi abbiamo nel nostro ordinamento il divieto esplicito di interventi militari diretti, al di fuori di quanto previsto dalle leggi e dalla Costituzione. Possiamo prevedere interventi armati solo su mandato internazionale, ad esempio in attuazione di una risoluzione dell’Onu. Quello ipotizzato in Ucraina non solo non rientrerebbe in questo caso, ma innescherebbe una ulteriore spiralizzazione del conflitto che non gioverebbe soprattutto agli stessi ucraini. Insomma, non esistono le condizioni per un nostro coinvolgimento diretto''. 

Crosetto risponde alla proposta di Macron, l'invio di truppe occidentali in Ucraina, escludendo un intervento diretto dei nostri militari. ""Non giudico un presidente di un paese amico come la Francia, ma non comprendo la finalità e l’utilità di queste dichiarazioni, che oggettivamente innalzano la tensione''. Per Crosetto ''se i Russi arrivassero a Kiev, se conquistassero un paese sovrano, se dessimo per scontato, come alcuni sedicenti esperti e professori compiacenti verso la Russia, e mi chiedo come si faccia a esserlo gratis... , che si può invadere un altro paese solo perché si è più forti, sarebbe un disastro per tutti''. Quindi l'Italia continuerà a ''fornire aiuti, come abbiamo fatto finora, finché sarà utile e finché potremo farlo''.

instagram,"A military court in Moscow has reportedly sentenced Meta Platforms spokesperson Andy Stone to six years in prison in absentia for ‘publicly defending terrorism.’ This ruling comes amid Russia’s crackdown on Meta, which was designated as an extremist organisation in the country, resulting in the banning of Facebook and Instagram in 2022 due to Russia’s conflict with Ukraine.

Meta has yet to comment on the reported sentencing of Stone, who serves as the company’s communications director. Stone himself was unavailable for immediate response following the court’s decision. Stone’s lawyer, Valentina Filippenkova, indicated they intend to appeal the verdict, expressing a request for acquittal.

The Russian interior ministry initiated a criminal investigation against Stone late last year, although the specific charges were not disclosed then. According to state investigators, Stone’s online comments allegedly defended ‘aggressive, hostile, and violent actions’ against Russian soldiers involved in what Russia terms its ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine.

Russia Steps Up Offensive in Eastern Ukraine

Russia has deployed more troops to Ocheretyne in eastern Ukraine as part of an offensive, but Ukrainian forces maintain control of most of the village and anticipate US arms deliveries to bolster their position, according to the Ukrainian military, Reuters reports.

The Russians have advanced through several villages in the east since capturing Avdiivka in February, as Ukrainian forces faced dwindling supplies. Fierce fighting continues in Ocheretyne, but Ukrainian forces claim to have two-thirds of the village under control. Russian forces are also targeting the strategic town of Chasiv Yar to the north, aiming to capture it as part of their larger push to control the Donbas region.

Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian morale received a boost with the approval of a major US aid package containing military assistance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned of a possible Russian offensive in late May or June.

instagram,"Banyak cara dan strategi Rusia untuk menjatuhkan mental pasukan Ukraina di medan perang sekaligus mempermalukan negara Barat anggota NATO yang selama ini jadi sekutu Ukraina. 

Satu diantaranya dengan menyelenggarakan pameran senjata hasil rampasan perang selama konflik Rusia melawan Ukraina di Kota Moskow.

Sebuah pameran peralatan militer Barat yang dirampas dari pasukan Kyiv selama pertempuran di Ukraina dibuka di ibu kota Rusia pada Rabu (1/5). 

Pameran yang diselenggarakan oleh Kementerian Pertahanan Rusia itu menampilkan lebih dari 30 alat berat buatan Barat, termasuk tank tempur M1 Abrams buatan AS dan kendaraan tempur lapis baja Bradley, tank Leopard 2 dan kendaraan infanteri lapis baja Marder dari Jerman, dan kendaraan lapis baja AMX-10RC buatan Prancis.

Lokasi pameran senjata itu diadakan di Victory Park, Moskow. Sebuah taman yang didedikasikan untuk kemenangan USSR terhadap Nazi pada Perang Dunia 2 dahulu.

Lokasi itu juga merupakan tempat dimana Napoleon Bonaparte berdiri pada 1812 sebelum memasuki Moskow pada Perang Patriot melawan Prancis

instagram,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24 2022, days after Russia recognised two breakaway Ukrainian republics. Russia’s invasion was, in fact, an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II. The invasion has caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory.

From a population of 41 million in January 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war led to global food crises. The war rages on but media fatigue has taken it off from the headlines. By September 2022, military costs were estimated at $40 billion. The 2022 GDP losses amounted to between $81 billion and $104 billion and financial capital destruction reached $322 billion by year-end.

instagram,"Russia has announced plans to integrate drone operations into the curriculum of schools located in occupied territories, effective September 1. This decision has sparked outrage, with many condemning it as a blatant violation of international law and humanitarian principles.

Ivan Fedorov, the head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration, took to Telegram to denounce the Kremlin's actions, stating, ""From September 1, 2024, schools in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine will introduce a new subject – a course on controlling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Officially, they may call it ‘training,’ but in reality they are preparing young people to kill.""

This revelation comes after Ukraine's National Resistance Center (NRC) disclosed similar plans by Russia earlier this year. According to the NRC, the curriculum will cover technical aspects and assembly of UAVs for military purposes, while also encouraging further education in technical fields and employment in military industries among students.

Fedorov further emphasized that Russia intends to provide every school with training UAVs and deploy Russian military personnel to instruct children. However, such actions are deeply concerning, as training minors for military purposes and potentially involving them in conflicts against their own nation constitute grave violations of international law.

The international community has expressed alarm over Russia's decision, calling for diplomatic efforts to address the situation and protect the rights of affected children. As tensions persist, the implications of this controversial move extend far beyond the borders of the occupied territories.

instagram,"Ukraine’s top commander has said Kyiv’s outnumbered troops fell back to new positions west of three villages on the eastern front, where Russia has concentrated significant forces in several locations.

Sunday’s statement by Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskii reflected on Ukraine’s deteriorating position in the east, which Kyiv hopes it can stabilise once it receives United States weapons under a $61bn aid package approved in the US this week.

“The situation at the front has worsened,” Syrskii wrote on the Telegram app, describing the “most difficult” areas as west of occupied Maryinka and northwest of Avdiivka, the town captured by Russian forces in February.

Kyiv’s troops, he said, had taken up new positions west of the villages of Berdychi and Semenivka, both north of Avdiivka, and Novomykhailivka, further south near the town of Maryinka.

“In general, the enemy achieved certain tactical successes in these areas, but could not gain operational advantages,” Oleksandr Syrskii said, adding that Russia had committed four brigades to the assault.

🇷🇺Rusya Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcü Maria Zakharova;

📌""NATO Konseyi'nin açıklaması, kamuoyunun dikkatini ittifakın gerçek eylemlerinden başka yöne çekmek amacıyla Avrupa ve Kuzey Amerika halklarını yanıltmaya yönelik çabalarla çok iyi örtüşüyor.""

📌""Şu anda NATO'nun Soğuk Savaş'tan bu yana en büyük tatbikatı olan Steadfast Defender Rusya sınırları yakınında gerçekleştiriliyor. Senaryolarına göre Rusya'ya yönelik koalisyon eylemleri, hibrit ve konvansiyonel silahlar da dahil olmak üzere tüm araçlarla uygulanıyor.""

📌""NATO'nun bizimle 'potansiyel bir çatışma'ya ciddi şekilde hazırlandığını kabul etmeliyiz.""

📌""Ancak Rusya'ya karşı tüm operasyon ortamlarında ve tüm coğrafi yönlerde hibrit bir savaş başlatan NATO'ydu.  Ve sadece hibrit değil Ukrayna'daki çatışmada, NATO üyeleri ülkemizle gerçek bir askeri çatışmaya aktif olarak katılıyorlar. Onlar sadece Kiev rejimini finanse etmekle kalmıyorlar, silah da sağlıyorlar, aynı zamanda ona istihbarat verileri de sağlıyorlar, bunun ardından Batı silahları Rus topraklarındaki sivilleri ve sivil altyapıyı vuruyor.""

Already displaced once in Yemen’s grinding civil war, Mohammed Ali Saleh fled with his pregnant wife and their three children to central Marib province last year to seek refuge in a region that has known some relative peace and stability because of well-protected oil fields nearby.

But now the fighting is moving toward them again.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels are pushing to capture the province from the internationally recognized government to try to complete their control over the northern half of Yemen. If they succeed, the Houthis could claim a strategic win after a largely stalemated battle in almost seven years of fighting.

The sounds of war terrify Saleh and his family.

Winston Churchill once said that “History is written by the victors”. There could be contrary views to this assertion, but this testimony surely does not resonate with the case of Russia-Ukraine War. As we are advancing, the complete collapse of Ukrainian Territory at the hands Russian Federation seems inevitable. 

But I suspect that this will ever go down in History the way things have truly unfolded. Well, the history is not really written by the victors, rather it is written by someone who is really good with documentation and narrative.

The book “Russia Forever” is a timely intervention into the field of geopolitical literature. Penned by Ashish Shukla, a geopolitical analyst who has shown his presence on International Media. If you follow the international media today, remarks in the favour of Ukraine truly dominates the narrative. 

The contemporary war in the region is not new. The seed of it was sowed back in 2014 with the Russia’s annexation of Crimea. But what were the reasons behind which forced Russians to barge into a sovereign state and to create it as buffer zone between NATO (Europe) and Itself?

The book draws you to a detailed background of this conflict which traces its roots back in time. Under Gorbachev, Russians were told about the Enlargement of NATO and a “guaranteed non-expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe”. 

But over the period of time, the bearers of utmost morality and truth — The Americans, gushed from the words of assurance given to the Russians and NATO expanded heavily & aggressively in Eastern Europe. Seeing it as a potential threat to the Russian Sovereignty, the invasion of Crimea happened followed by the current ongoing war.

Zelenskyy revealed in an interview with American broadcaster PBS that although 11 missiles were launched, only seven were intercepted. The remaining four successfully hit the Trypilska power station because there were no more available missiles for defense.

In other developments, Zelenskyy has signed a new mobilization law which will come into effect one month after its official publication. This legislation mandates men to update their draft information with authorities, increases payments for volunteers, and imposes additional penalties for those evading the draft.

Keep getting better day by day,
Consistency is the key,
Write down your thought process on paper,

And see on what pattern is your mind working on,
You should be aware of most of your thoughts,
because when you are a trader, it's very important that you know how your mind works,

It feels bad when you lose money,
But you need to understand that there is no point in trading where you will reach and stop making losses,
So when you know you can't eliminate something, accept that, and try to manage your mindset accordingly...

The delay in approving new funding was costly, undermining Kyiv’s fight against invading Russian forces. Ukraine has received only limited aid this year due to opposition from some Republicans in the House of Representatives. The gaps in assistance left Kyiv’s troops vulnerable, as they ran short of key items such as artillery munitions.

The move aims to bolster Ukrainian forces, who have faced challenges against Russian incursions. Biden emphasized the urgency, stating, ""We need to move fast."" The package, which includes critical air defense systems and artillery, signifies a shift in Washington's Ukraine policy, overcoming previous delays caused by partisan disputes. Biden stressed the importance of standing by allies and opposing tyrants, reaffirming America's role as the ""indispensable nation."" The aid package, including advanced weaponry like Stinger missiles and infantry vehicles, is seen as vital in addressing the gaps caused by months of delay. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy welcomed the support, while the Kremlin condemned it, warning of consequences. In addition to aid for Ukraine, the bill includes provisions affecting Israel, Taiwan, and a requirement for TikTok's parent company to divest its U.S. operations. Biden and his administration have underscored the significance of aiding Ukraine, highlighting the potential ramifications of inaction on NATO cohesion and regional stability. Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the support, emphasizing the need to counter Putin's influence for the preservation of freedom.

Instagram Caption: The US House of Representatives has approved a $60.84 billion security aid package for Ukraine, with $23 billion allocated for replenishing US weapons and facilities. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warns that the decision could exacerbate destruction and loss of life in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Russia is concerned about provisions that allow the confiscation of Russian assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. Critics, such as former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, argue that the aid is motivated by Russophobia and benefits the US military-industrial complex. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova cautions that this assistance could deepen global crises, particularly in Taiwan and Israel.

instagram,"Russel Bentley, conosciuto con il nom de guerre di Texas e ""Il Cowboy del Donbass"" era un cittadino americano, texano che nel 2014 andò nel Donbass per combattere con le milizie separatiste di Donetsk. Circa due settimane fa la moglie una ucraina di Donetsk, ne denunciò la scomparsa, ed alcuni giorni fa è stato ritrovato il cadavere di Bentley. I canali filo-russi inizialmente hanno accusato gli ucraini, ma pare siano stati gli stessi russi ad eliminarlo brutalmente. Si parla di un regolamento di conti per questioni criminali, al fatto che alcuni reparti russi al sentirlo parlare inglese e non conoscendolo abbiano pensato ad una spia; l'ipotesi più probabile è che sia stato rapito, torturato e ucciso dal 5into battaglione Tank, composto esclusivamente da Buriati.

All the history, politics, and everything else is written in this. The content is methodical. The best part is that it's written by an army veteran. This is my first experience of reading a book by an army veteran. 🪖

As we know, there is a long history that went with Russia and Ukraine. The author has covered all the parts in detail, giving the readers a fair idea. It's important for us to understand this, as part of GK. The author has researched well and it is seen in his writing.

It was not easy to hear from them about the impact of war on people's lives in Russia.
War is never suitable for anyone!
So before you pick any side, listen to people from both sides and what war did to them.
I have visited both the countries #Russia and #Ukraine, and I have excellent friends from both countries, and I sincerely feel their pain. I can't pick any side; all I want is this war to end and we all live in peace and harmony... Is it too much to ask?

instagram,"Since the unification of Yemen in 1990 the political, economic and military leadership was dominated by the Northerners which resulted in continuous conflicts. They however continued to work together in the fight against Al Qaeda and Houthis.

The failure of President Hadi against Al Qaeda and Houthis encouraged the revival of a long suppressed secessionist movement in Southern Yemen, Al-Hirak al-Janoubi commonly called Hirak.

In 2018, the Separatists occupied the government at Aden in a coup d’état against the Hadi government and in April 2020 declared self-rule in Aden, saying it would govern the port city and southern provinces.

So in effect Yemen is now governed by three separate entities, Houthis in North Yemen, STC and Hadi faction in Southern part of Yemen. Apart from this in many of the areas of tribal hinterland, Al Qaeda is running its writ.

instagram,"The recent drone attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant, a critical nuclear facility with six reactors, has intensified fears of a potential catastrophic nuclear accident, as cautioned by the UN's atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have reached a critical point, with both sides trading accusations regarding the attack. While Russia alleges Ukrainian involvement, Ukraine vehemently denies any responsibility. The IAEA's Director General, Rafael Grossi, described the drone strike as reckless and a significant escalation in the already precarious situation surrounding nuclear safety and security at the plant. The Zaporizhzhia facility, located in southern Ukraine, holds the distinction of being the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Since the full-scale invasion by Russian forces in February 2022, the plant has been under Russian control. Despite assurances from the plant's administration that radiation levels remain within acceptable limits and that there is no substantial damage, the IAEA has expressed concerns about the potential impact on the integrity of the reactor's containment system. This incident underscores the grave risks posed by the ongoing conflict and the imperative of safeguarding nuclear facilities to prevent a potentially catastrophic outcome.

instagram,"📌 In the dead of night in May, Russia launched a Kinzhal hypersonic missile at the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, reaching speeds up to Mach 10 (about 7,700 mph). The U.S. had sent a Patriot air defense system to Ukraine to counter Russian missiles, successfully intercepting the Kinzhal missile and others. The Patriot system has demonstrated its capabilities by intercepting Russian aircraft and missiles in Ukraine. The U.S. Army is planning to replace the Patriot system with an Integrated Air and Missile Defense system, but the Patriot’s recent success has attracted global interest.

Republicans in Congress have been blocking tens of billions of dollars in military assistance for Kyiv for months.

“It is necessary to specifically tell Congress that if Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war,” Zelensky said during a video meeting of Kyiv-organised fundraising platform United24.

Zelensky said it would be “difficult” for Ukraine to “stay” (survive) without the aid.

He said that “if Ukraine loses the war, other states will be attacked.” Read details in the link in our bio.

Argentina posee 2 Mi-171E actualmente fuera de servicio, no posee una gran cantidad de armamento Ruso o Soviético.

Seria una gran posibilidad para la industria nacional,  radares, drones de todo tipo. Luego la Fabricaciones Militares Sociedad del Estado (FMSE) puede producir estandar OTAN, municiones de 120mm para morteros, municiones 105mm para artillería, cohetes MLRS y tambien municiones de bajo calibre, la linea de fabricación existe, pero debido a la falta de pedido tienen una capacidad limitada.

Una gran oportunidad de la industria nacional de abastecer al mercado Europeo que se esta desarmando para abastecer a Ucrania y tambien a la misma Ucrania.

instagram,"La presidente del Consiglio Giorgia Meloni, durante la riunione del Consiglio dei ministri a palazzo Chigi, ha annunciato l’indicazione di Raffaele Fitto come commissario europeo. “Oggi stesso comunicherò alla presidente von der Leyen il nome” di Fitto come commissario europeo “e chiedo a tutti di rivolgere un applauso e un grande in bocca al lupo a Raffaele, che avrà davanti un compito estremamente complesso e allo stesso tempo entusiasmante”, ha detto Meloni in cdm definendola “una scelta dolorosa per me, credo anche per lui, e per il governo, ma è una scelta necessaria“. “Si tratta – ha aggiunto – di una scelta delicata e molto importante per noi e per l’Italia nei prossimi anni. La nostra scelta ricade su una persona che ha una grandissima esperienza e che ha saputo governare le deleghe che gli sono state affidate in questo governo con ottimi risultati”.

Prima del cdm sempre a Palazzo Chigi si è tenuto il vertice di maggioranza tra la presidente del Consiglio, Giorgia Meloni, i vice e segretari di Forza Italia e Lega Antonio Tajani e Matteo Salvini, e il leader di Noi moderati Maurizio Lupi. Una riunione durata più di tre ore. Durante il vertice “i leader hanno rinnovato il patto di coalizione, garanzia di efficacia e concretezza dell’azione di governo. Un bilancio positivo sostenuto da dati macroeconomici incoraggianti, a partire dal buon andamento della crescita dell’occupazione“, si legge nella nota congiunta. Comunicato che ha provocato anche qualche problema: la nota diffusa dalla Lega infatti conteneva una frase relativa alla contrarietà del governo “a ogni ipotesi di interventi militari fuori dai confini ucraini“.

 Riferimento modificato, nella nota ufficiale, con la formula “Condivisione sulla posizione del governo italiano relativamente alla guerra in Ucraina“. “Per la fretta“, ha fatto sapere la Lega, è stata diffusa “una versione del comunicato che poi è stata modificata“.

instagram,"How you can support Ukraine

As the war in Ukraine keeps raging, the humanitarian toll keeps mounting. The United Nations reports roughly 14 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the Russian invasion. Scores of global nonprofits have responded to the crisis, delivering desperately needed aid to Ukrainians who have fled abroad and those who remain in the war-torn country. The NGOs include GlobalGiving — which has raised more than $48 million to provide shelter, water and economic assistance to refugees — and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is providing medical equipment and emergency supplies and aiding civilian evacuation efforts.

Al-Habbash stated that although more than 120 countries have supported UN resolutions on Palestine, they have not yet been put into effect.

The Al-Shifa Hospital's core blood bank was destroyed after 350 days of nonstop shelling, making it practically impossible to supply the critically needed blood needed by the sick and injured Palestinians.

This situation is made worse by the fact that even individuals who would be ready to donate blood are unable to do so because of malnourishment brought on by the region's prevalent hunger.

इजराइल और गाज़ा युद्ध के दौरान इजराइल के हमलों से गाज़ा में एक आंकड़ों के अनुसार अबतक लगभग 41000 हजार पलेस्तीनी मारे जा चुके है । मरने वालों में यह आंकड़ा उपलब्ध रिकॉर्ड के आधार पर है, जबकि मरने वालों के वास्तविक आंकड़े इसके चार गुना से अधिक हैं । गाज़ा में कूल जनसंख्या में मरने वालों की संख्या 10 प्रतिशत से अधिक है ।  इजराइल के हमलों से अंतराष्ट्रीय कानूनों के साथ ही विश्वभर में निर्धारित मानवाधिकार के मापदंडों का खुले तौर पर उल्लंघन किया गया जिसके कारण गाज़ा के 96 प्रतिशत नागरिकों के सामने खाद्य सुरक्षा के संकट पैदा हो गया हैं । इजराइल के द्वारा अपने हमलों से गाज़ा के शिक्षण संस्थानों, यूनिवर्सिटियों, स्वास्थ्य सेवाओं को पूरे तरीके से ध्वस्त किया जा चुका है । 

इजराइल ने गाज़ा में नरसंहार कर मानवाधिकारों के सभी मापदंडों का उल्लंघन किया है और ऐसे नरसंहार के बाद भी इंडियन इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ साइंस, बेंगलुरु के द्वारा इसराइली प्रतिनिधियों के साथ समीट किया जाना,यह बताता है कि संस्थान दुनिया में हो रहे नरसंहार का समर्थन करता है । इस समीट के विरोध में देश भर के शिक्षण संस्थानों के छात्र-छात्राओं के हस्ताक्षर कराकर आईआईएस, बेंगलुरु को भेजा गया था कि संस्थान तत्काल प्रभाव से इजराइल के साथ होने वाले इस समीट को रद्द किया जाए, किंतु संस्थान ने छात्रों के लिखित विरोध और प्रदर्शन के बावजूद इस समीट को होने की अनुमति दी है । उल्लेखनीय है कि इस समीट के विरोध में खड़े छात्रों में देश भर के आईआईएम, आईआईटी, केंद्रीय विश्विद्यालयों के अलावा मेडिकल जगत से भी छात्रों ने अपना विरोध दर्ज कराया है ।

She also took classes on International Relations, Statecraft, and Integrated Strategy with Dr. John Callahan, and Intelligence Collection with Dr. Nathan Hodge.

Of her experience, she said, ""This internship taught me exactly what I was looking for: the nuances within the perspectives the United States holds in its practice of foreign policy, its history, and how it relates to its domestic politics.""

Turkiye is reportedly exercising extreme caution when it comes to the safety of its ""Oruc Reis"" vessel, especially because it is meant to operate in open waters off the coast of Somalia, according to a report by Middle East Eye that quoted two people with knowledge of the situation.

The vessel is scheduled to carry out a 3D seismic survey in the region, which Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar stated last week ""had never been done before."" Turkish Petroleum holds a license for three areas in Somali waters, each field covering 5,000 square kilometers.

The resolution seeks to implement the International Court of Justice’s 19 July advisory opinion. The opinion reiterated the illegality of Israel’s occupation, annexation and settlement expansion, and called for action “to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.” Although “advisory” and thus “non-binding”, legal experts point out that the laws upon which it is based are binding on all UN member states.""

The strike was part of a series of operations in the northern West Bank, where violence has surged since the start of the war in Gaza. Palestinian health authorities report over 680 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October 7, including fighters and unarmed civilians. The Israeli military says the operations aim to counter terrorism, but critics argue they only fuel more violence and instability.

For those that need a history lesson, when the Soviet Union disbanded, NATO agreed it would not recruit surrounding nations of Russia’s such as Poland, Ukraine, and others or Russia would rightly see that as a strategic disadvantage and hostile threat to their livelihood and existence. NATO broke that promise long ago, why? Cause they work for the war machine.

• Enhances team relationships.
• Encourages creativity and innovation.
• Builds a cohesive and engaged workforce.

Embrace conflict.

Encourage debate.

instagram,"I have Palestinian and Israeli friends, and I'm at a loss about what's ""right"" or ""wrong."" Frustration grew when I found myself in a demonstration in Berlin, the other day, where both sides were just yelling at each other. Being physically between the parties was completely different from the distanced view we usually have thru the media. The unyielding hostility was palpable. It hurts to see people I care about caught in such a deep conflict. Damn complicated, if not hopeless.

instagram,"Moscow has blocked access to 81 Western media sites from 25 EU nations, accusing them of spreading false information about its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The term ""war"" or ""invasion"" is criminalized in Russia. This move follows the EU's decision in May to ban four Russian media outlets, which Brussels labelled as Kremlin propaganda. The blocked Western outlets include AFP, Der Spiegel, El Pais, and state broadcasters from Austria, Ireland, and Italy. Politico was also banned. European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova condemned Moscow's action as ""nonsense"" on social media.

Russia's Foreign Ministry stated that the ban would be reconsidered if the EU lifted its Russian media restrictions, which they described as politically motivated. The escalation in media restrictions comes amid heightened tensions following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Many Western media organizations had already withdrawn staff from Russia to avoid repercussions under new laws against ""discrediting"" the Russian military. The latest ban coincides with the espionage trial of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained for a year. Russia's ranking on the Press Freedom Index remains low, with frequent reports of journalists being jailed, harassed, or killed.

So what
Russia is well aware that they are currently in an information war, and they have a long history of using propaganda dating back to before the soviet revolution. While the internet has allowed people to get their media from various sources, it has also allowed state actors to flood the information space with competing narratives to sow confusion (one of Russia's favoured tactics). It is possible that this move comes due to Western governments finally taking note of the information war and looking to put more effort into winning it. Additionally, it is likely that as the conflict in Ukraine drags on, Russians have looked for alternative narratives around what is happening, something the Kremlin will want to subdue.

The man can be seen cursing and calling the bus driver a ""Muslim terrorist"" on multiple occasions in the footage.

Additionally, after the driver was observed punching the bus's safety screen and spitting, he demanded that the man get off the vehicle.

instagram,"Hamas Picks New Boss: Because Even Terrorist Groups Need New Management Sometimes
*
Over the past week, top Hamas leaders gathered in Qatar to pick a new political head after Ismail Haniyeh was killed. They arrived from across the Middle East, some still shaken after fighting Israel in Gaza. Haniyeh, the group's previous leader, died in a blast in Tehran allegedly by Israel. Talk about a hostile takeover!

At the mourning ceremony in Doha, leaders lined up to pay their respects, but really, they were eyeing his vacant position. One man stood out—Abu Omar Hassan, head of Hamas's Supreme Shura Council. No, he's not a Bond villain...yet.

After two days of intense meetings, they went with Yahya Sinwar, who’s been leading Hamas in Gaza since 2017. He's close to the militant wing—basically, he's their LinkedIn top candidate. Israel believes he planned attacks on southern Israel and now he's top of their hit list. Some Hamas leaders wanted a more moderate leader, but apparently, extremism got the majority vote.

instagram,"'Chinese reactions to Modi’s visit to Ukraine reflect a range of perspectives. 

One analysis provided three key reasons for Modi’s Ukraine visit. First, it suggests that Modi’s visit aligns with a utilitarian approach to diplomacy: while Russia offers valuable resources and technology to India, the West provides markets and investment opportunities. Thus, Modi’s trip can be seen as part of a strategic effort to balance these interests.

Second, by engaging directly with Ukraine and trying to mediate the conflict, Modi aims to bolster his image as a prominent global leader, enhancing India’s stature on the world stage.

Third, the visit is viewed through the lens of competition with China. The commentary highlighted that India’s desire to match China’s diplomatic moves is evident, especially following Beijing’s recent invitation to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba. Modi’s visit, announced shortly after Kuleba’s departure from China on 26 July, seems strategically timed to capitalise on this competitive dynamic.'

instagram,"Tensions in the Middle East are at a breaking point as Israeli airstrikes have targeted multiple locations in Gaza, killing a senior rescue service official, and in Syria, where 14 people have lost their lives. 

The escalating violence has extended to Jordan, where an armed assailant fatally shot three security guards at the King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge border crossing. In response, Israel has closed all border crossings with Jordan, heightening fears of further regional instability. This surge in violence marks a critical point in the ongoing conflict, with broader implications for neighboring countries and peace efforts in the region.

instagram,"One of Gaza's last functioning hospitals has been emptying out in recent days as Israel has ordered the evacuation of nearby areas and signaled a possible ground operation in a town that has been largely spared throughout the war, officials said Monday.

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah is the main hospital serving central Gaza. The Israeli military has not ordered its evacuation, but patients and people sheltering there fear that it may be engulfed in fighting or become the target of a raid.

""We are importing aid because we have nowhere else to go. In the world we live in today, we are unable to conduct a war. Until our captives are released, no one will allow us to inflict the deaths of two million civilians from hunger, even though it could be morally and legally justified. It is morally acceptable to swap humanitarianism for humanitarianism, but how can we act? We need worldwide legitimacy for this conflict because we are living in a specific context today,"" he declared.

instagram,"Israel has returned the bodies of nearly 90 Palestinians killed in its military offensive in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said.

Yamen Abu Suleiman, the director of the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said on Monday that it was unclear whether the bodies had been dug up from cemeteries by the army during the ground offensive, or whether they were “detainees who had been tortured and killed”.

“The occupation provided us with no information about the names, or ages, or anything. This is a war crime, a crime against humanity,” Abu Suleiman said.

He said the bodies would be examined in an attempt to determine the causes of death and to identify them, before being buried in a mass grave at a cemetery near Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.

Gaza’s Government Media Office said Israel had sent 89 bodies as “bones and decomposed bodies in an inhumane manner”.

instagram,"At least nine people, including a local commander of Hamas’s military wing, have been killed in two separate Israeli air strikes near Tulkarem in the occupied West Bank.

Medical sources confirmed to Al Jazeera on Saturday that one of the people killed in the first attack was Haitham Balidi, leader of the Qassam Brigades in the Nablus area. Another person was identified by a relative as one of the leaders of al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group.

The identities of the other people were not immediately clear. Family members went to a hospital in Tulkarem to identify the dismembered bodies brought there.

The Israeli military said the car contained a “terrorist squad” that was on its way to carry out an attack, without providing evidence.

A few hours later, a second air attack on a vehicle in Bal’a, east of Tulkarem, killed four people, according to Wafa news agency.

Shortly after the initial attack, Israeli forces launched raids in Tulkarem, resulting in confrontations with Palestinian fighters. Israeli forces also fired tear gas at journalists who were covering the raid.

instagram,"What Happened: Turkey to submit declaration to International Court of Justice intervening in South Africa's case against Israel over alleged genocide in Gaza.

What you need to know: Turkey will submit a declaration to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Wednesday, intervening in a case against Israel regarding alleged genocide in Gaza. The declaration aims to bring attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and support South Africa's case. 

More: Turkey's move follows Spain's similar intervention in June. Israel has denied the genocide accusations, claiming its actions in Gaza are self-defense measures targeting Hamas militants. The ICJ, established in 1945, will consider the declarations as it reviews the case. 

Also: Turkey's foreign minister announced the move, which comes after Turkey increased measures against Israel over the Gaza assault. The submission will take place at 1330 GMT on Wednesday.

instagram,"Russia has strongly condemned the killing of a senior Hamas leader, calling it a ""political murder"" and a ""gross violation of international law"". The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the killing was a deliberate attack on a political figure and a blatant disregard for Palestinian sovereignty.

The Hamas leader, who was not named, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza. Israel has not commented on the incident, but it is believed to have been a targeted killing. Russia's condemnation of the attack reflects its support for the Palestinian cause and its criticism of Israel's actions in the region.

Russia's Foreign Ministry also called for an international investigation into the killing, stating that those responsible must be held accountable. The ministry expressed its condolences to the family of the deceased and the Palestinian people, and reiterated its support for a comprehensive and just settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from across the globe, with many countries and organizations calling for restraint and an end to the cycle of violence in the region. The killing has also raised tensions between Israel and Hamas, which has vowed to retaliate for the attack.

instagram,"With the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the League of Nations assigned Palestine to a British mandate in 1920. This 1935 Palestine coin features “Palestine” written in British Mandate Palestine’s three official languages: English, Arabic, and Hebrew. Article 22 of the 1922 Palestine Mandate states: “Any statement or inscription in Arabic on stamps or money in Palestine shall be repeated in Hebrew, and any statement or inscription in Hebrew shall be repeated in Arabic.” The British administration at times supported creating a “national home” in Palestine for Jewish people as stated in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. This support was echoed in the language choices the British Mandate enforced on the coins.

On July 27, 2024, a rocket fired from Lebanon struck a soccer field in Majdal Shams, a Druze town in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. The attack, described as the deadliest on civilians since October 7, 2023, has heightened fears of a broader regional conflict, as reported by AP. 

The Israeli military reported that the rocket caused extensive damage and that 20 others were injured. Residents described the scene as horrific, with many expressing a deep sense of loss and anger. Israeli officials are investigating why the rocket was not intercepted by defense systems.

In response, Israel has conducted airstrikes on targets in Lebanon, marking an escalation in the ongoing cross-border conflict with Hezbollah. Despite these strikes, Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack, while the U.S. and Israeli officials point to indications that it was involved.

The incident comes amid stalled negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Hezbollah will face severe consequences. The Israeli security cabinet is deliberating on further actions, while international efforts, led by the U.S. and Egypt, are pushing for de-escalation.

This escalation threatens to further destabilize the region, already tense from the ongoing Gaza conflict and frequent border skirmishes. The White House National Security Council is engaging with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts to seek a diplomatic resolution and prevent further violence.

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of trying to embrace Hamas, even though the militants are Israel's primary enemy, labeled as a terrorist organization.

China has supported the Palestinian struggle since the era of Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestine. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has remained consistent in its support for Palestinian independence.

The Israeli military said in a statement it had targeted a “Hamas command and control centre inside the Khadija school compound in central Gaza”.

The statement said the school was being used to launch attacks against troops and as a weapons cache and that it warned civilians before the raid.

instagram,"Kamala Harris, Wakil Presiden Amerika Serikat, telah menyampaikan perubahan besar dalam kebijakan AS terkait perang Gaza. Dalam pertemuan dengan Perdana Menteri Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, di Washington, Harris menyerukan diakhirinya konflik dan mendukung pembentukan negara Palestina. Dia menegaskan bahwa AS tidak akan tinggal diam terhadap penderitaan yang dialami oleh rakyat Palestina.

Harris mengkritik pendekatan Presiden Joe Biden yang mendukung Israel dan menyoroti penderitaan yang terjadi di Gaza selama sembilan bulan terakhir. Dia menggambarkan gambar anak-anak yang tewas dan orang-orang yang putus asa serta kelaparan yang terus berusaha melarikan diri demi keselamatan. Harris menegaskan bahwa dunia tidak bisa berpaling dari tragedi ini dan bahwa dia tidak akan tinggal diam.

Dalam pertemuan tersebut, Harris menekankan kepada Netanyahu tentang skala penderitaan manusia di Gaza dan kematian warga sipil yang tidak bersalah. Dia juga menyatakan keprihatinan serius tentang situasi kemanusiaan di sana. Selain itu, Harris menyerukan gencatan senjata antara Israel dan Hamas serta pembebasan sandera untuk mengakhiri perang yang dimulai pada Oktober 2023.

Pernyataan Harris ini sangat berbeda dengan pendekatan ramah antara Biden dan Netanyahu sebelumnya. Sikap tegas Harris menunjukkan bahwa dia mungkin mengambil pendekatan yang lebih keras terhadap Israel dibandingkan Biden. Harris juga mengutuk anti-Semitisme, Islamofobia, dan segala bentuk kebencian, serta menyerukan persatuan dalam menghadapi situasi ini.

Menurut Kementerian Kesehatan Gaza, sebanyak 39.175 warga tewas karena serangan Israel, dengan 90.000 \orang lainnya terluka. Harris menyampaikan bahwa gencatan senjata dan bantuan kemanusiaan sangat dibutuhkan untuk mengurangi penderitaan warga sipil yang tidak bersalah di Gaza.

instagram,"BREAKING NEWS:

On Monday, July 29, Gaza’s health ministry declared a polio epidemic across the Palestinian enclave. They have largely attributed this outbreak to Israel and their relentless attacks. A WHO spokesperson warned that a ceasefire must be ordered to ensure that vaccines can be administered in Gaza. Currently, both Hamas and Israel’s Prime Minister blame each other for halts in ceasefire negotiations, and it seems that talks are unproductive at this time.

What are the feelings of Palestinians living in Europe about the current situation? 😔

On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas, a terrorist organization that took control of Gaza in 2007, launched an attack on Israel. Hamas stands for the Islamic Resistance Movement. The group detests Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. Hamas calls for the destruction of Israel as a whole and seeks to create an Islamic state in its place.

instagram,"Multiple rockets were launched at Iraq's Ain Al-Asad Air Base, which houses US-led forces, late yesterday, according to US and Iraqi sources. No damage or deaths were reported, according to Reuters.

Two US officials stated that the base itself was not targeted in the attack.

The incident occurred two days after a military summit in Washington, where Iraqi and US officials discussed winding down the coalition's operations a decade after it was created to combat Daesh in Iraq and Syria.

There was no dramatic statement at the end of the negotiations, but US and Iraqi sources suggest it will begin to wind down gradually in the coming weeks.

instagram,"Questa sera esulo dall’ambito consueto della poesia giapponese per offrirvi uno splendido aforisma dello scrittore e poeta palestinese Nasser Abu Srour, autore del libro “Il racconto del muro”, edito da @feltrinelli_editore.

L’assolutezza dell’esperienza amorosa mi sembra colta con grande efficacia dalle sue parole: “essere”, e non più avere, lo spazio e il tempo, farsi uno con l’altro e con il tutto, illimitato, eterno ed assoluto.

Nel suo libro, Srour esplora l’essenza dell’amore e della resistenza attraverso le sue esperienze di prigionia nelle carceri israeliane. Arrestato nel 1993 e condannato all'ergastolo, Srour trasforma il muro della sua cella nel simbolo di un dialogo paradossale, all’apparenza impossibile.

Diviso in due parti, il libro narra inizialmente la storia di Srour e della sua famiglia, riflettendo sulle sofferenze dei profughi palestinesi e sulle lotte della Prima Intifada. Nella seconda parte, invece, ci immergiamo nella sua intensa relazione epistolare con Nanna, un amore che sfida le barriere fisiche e temporali, valicando le anguste mura carcerarie.

L’appassionato racconto di Abu Srour non si riduce al solo memoir, ma è anche un profondo trattato filosofico che intreccia politica, storia e letteratura, offrendo una visione unica del conflitto israelo-palestinese e della resilienza umana in condizioni estreme. Un libro che invita a riflettere su come l’amore possa realmente trascendere ogni limite, facendosi mezzo privilegiato di liberazione.

Che ne pensate di questo aforisma di Nasser Abu Srour? Ha colto il senso e la pienezza dell’esperienza amorosa?",-1.0,29.0,,israelpalestineconflict,Poesia e cultura giapponese 🌙🌸,2024-07-28T16:35:41.000Z

instagram,"Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack on his residence in Tehran, confirmed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

If Israel is blamed for this, Hamas could significantly escalate its response. This comes right after Israel struck the capital of Lebanon to target Hezbollah.

It creates a leadership vacuum in Hamas as no successor has been announced yet.

In April, his video of reacting to the deaths of three of his sons and other relatives in an Israeli airstrike went viral after he said they were 'awarded this honour.'

Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards were killed after their residence was targeted in Tehran, confirmed by IRGC in a statement.

Haniyeh had attended the inauguration of Iran's new president and met Iran's Supreme Leader the day before the attack.

• The attack on Haniyeh's residence is being investigated, and results will be announced later in the day.

• The IRGC's Public Relations Department stated that the attack was carried out early Wednesday, and a probe is underway to find the cause of the incident.

• The IRGC extended condolences to the people of Palestine, the Muslim world, and the Resistance Front's fighters.

instagram,"“The myth of Israel as a democracy has no factual basis, yet it, too, has become an indisputable fact. Israel has from the very beginning defined itself as a racist apartheid state that prefers Jews. No attempt has been made to hide this fact, and for almost seven decades Israeli lawmakers have made it their business to develop the state for the Jewish population at the expense of the Palestinian population, be they citizens, residents or simply people living without any legal definition at all. Palestinians have been pushed out of every aspect of the life of the state from the very beginning, not to mention the fact that they were pushed out of the country and not allowed to return. The web of laws that govern the lives of Palestinians, whether they live in Jaffa, Haifa, Jerusalem, the Naqab desert, Ramallah, Jenin or Khan Younis, is too complicated to even attempt to understand, yet regardless of where in Palestine Palestinians reside, they are governed by the state of Israel under laws that are vastly different than the ones that govern the lives of Jewish Israelis.”

You may be in some place when suddenly you have a thought of Teshuvah and a deep longing for God. Stop then and there in that very place and take a moment to focus on the thought and the feeling of longing. Turn them into a prayer. Put your longing into words straight from your heart. Don't wait or move on, even if you are not in your usual place of prayer and study - even if you are going on your way - because if you move on, it could interrupt your train of thought.

instagram,"JERUSALEM: Facing intense pressure to quickly cut a ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to deliver a landmark speech to the US Congress on Wednesday.

While Netanyahu will become the first foreign leader to address a joint meeting of the two chambers four times, pulling ahead of Britain’s Winston Churchill on three, an expected meeting between Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden is still not confirmed.

Publicly, Biden has voiced strong support for Israel, but he expressed concern over an offensive on the southern city of Rafah in May and for a while suspended deliveries of heavy bombs to Israel.

“Never before has the atmosphere been so fraught,” said Council on Foreign Relations Middle East specialist Steven Cook. “There is clearly tension in the relationship, especially between the White House and the Israeli prime minister,” Cook said in a commentary.
One Jewish senator, Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii, announced he would boycott Wednesday’s speech, saying he would not listen to “political rhetoric that will do nothing to bring peace in the region”.

On July 19, the International Court of Justice found Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories “illegal”, months after it called for the country to stop genocide in Gaza.

Blinken urged Israel and Hamas to resolve the ""remaining issues"" and come to a ceasefire in Gaza.

Palestine issued a strong condemnation of Israel, accusing it of bombing refugee camps and hospitals, and called for adherence to international law. In response, Israel asserted that Hamas is exploiting civilian groups. Denmark voiced support for a humanitarian ceasefire, emphasizing the urgent need to address the humanitarian crisis. The debate highlighted the complex dynamics of the ongoing conflict, with nations expressing diverse perspectives on the situation. As discussions continue, the committee seeks to navigate these challenging issues while working towards a resolution that prioritizes civilian safety and international cooperation.

Kamala Harris, believed to be the Democrats' presidential candidate did not attend Netanyahu's speech, signaling solidarity with the protesters, which would be a tricky position for the Democrats' foreign policy, if she were to win the elections.
She was attending a campaign rally in Indiana instead.

Netanyahu emphasized the close ties between the US and Israel, calling for unity in their fight against Hamas and other Iran-backed groups.

His speech was met with applause from many lawmakers but also boycotts by over 60 Democrats and political independent Bernie Sanders, as per News18.

Netanyahu did not directly address ongoing US-led mediation for a cease-fire and hostage-release, showing no eagerness for such a deal.

Meanwhile, Thousands of protesters gathered near the Capitol, calling for a ceasefire and condemning Netanyahu, with some protesters burning the American flag too.

instagram,"📌 Adidas recently launched a campaign featuring model Bella Hadid to promote the relaunch of their classic SL72 sneaker, which was originally released in 1972 - the same year as the Munich Olympics. However, this collaboration has sparked significant backlash due to the tragic events that occurred at those Olympics.

📌 In 1972, Palestinian militants from the group Black September attacked and killed 11 Israeli athletes during the Munich Olympics. Bella Hadid, who is of Palestinian descent, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza. Her involvement in promoting a shoe tied to the Munich massacre has angered many, including the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and the Israeli government.

📌 The AJC stated that Adidas' choice of Hadid, a ""vocal anti-Israel model,"" to represent a shoe commemorating the Munich Olympics was either a ""massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory."" Israel's Foreign Ministry accused Hadid of ""spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews.""

📌 In response to the backlash, Adidas issued an apology, stating: ""We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused. As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign.""

📌 The company also emphasized its belief in sport as a unifying force and its commitment to championing diversity and equality. However, the incident has highlighted the ongoing tensions and sensitivities surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in the context of sports and advertising.

instagram,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) declared today that Israel's settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law, and it must compensate Palestinians who have lost property and income as a result.

The ICJ concluded that Israel's transfer of settlers to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as its continued presence, violates the sixth paragraph of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

instagram,"As reported by Anadolu Agency, the Yemeni Houthi group warned on Friday to step up operations and hit ""highly sensitive"" sites in Israel.

At a pro-Gaza march in the capital city of Sana'a, Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi, a member of the group's Supreme Political Council, told sizable audiences, ""As long as you continue your attacks in Gaza, be assured that our armed forces’ operations are continuously escalating.""

He went on, ""Today's operation is just one of these advanced operations, and they will continue. It reached the center of your decision-making, Tel Aviv.""

instagram,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a significant advisory opinion declaring Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories illegal. 

This ruling, released on July 19, 2024, emphasizes that Israel must cease its occupation and dismantle settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the court deems violations of international law. 

The ICJ's opinion stems from a request by the UN General Assembly following a Palestinian initiative.

KEY FINDINGS OF THE ICJ RULING:

📌 ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The court stated that Israel's ongoing presence in the Palestinian territories is ""unlawful"" and must be ended ""AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE."" It highlighted various policies, including the expansion of settlements and discriminatory practices against Palestinians, as breaches of international law.

📌 CALL FOR REPARATIONS: The ICJ also called for Israel to provide reparations for damages inflicted on individuals in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, although the specifics of these reparations remain to be determined. This includes RESTITUTION, COMPENSATION, AND SATISFACTION FOR THE AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS.

📌 GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS: The ruling urges all nations to collaborate with the UN to address Israel's illegal presence and uphold the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. It signals a shift in international attitudes towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and could influence future diplomatic relations and policies regarding Israel.

instagram,"Excavation works began Wednesday in the town of Tal Afar in Mosul, northern Iraq, with the discovery of a mass grave thought to contain the remains of Turkmen victims who were all likely killed by Daesh between 2014 and 2017.

Thousands of Iraqi Turkmen families who have been missing their loved ones for years are waiting for the bodies of their relatives to be recovered from what is known as Daesh's ""massacre well"" locally.

The well, known locally as ""Allov Anter,"" is about ten kilometers south of Tal Afar and plunges deeper than 100 meters. Daesh dubbed it the ""Well of Hell."" After capturing control of the region on June 9, 2014, Daesh allegedly killed thousands of people and disposed of their bodies in the well.

instagram,"JUST IN: 🇮🇱 🇵🇸 The International Court of Justice declares that Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and all settlements is illegal, rejecting all arguments made by Israel, the United States, and other Western countries, ruling that that their occupation should come to an end “as rapidly as possible”.

In addition, the ICJ stated that Israel is enforcing apartheid and racial segregation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The court’s opinion was sought in a 2022 request from the United Nations General Assembly.

The World Court, or International Court of Justice, is the highest UN tribunal for adjudicating conflicts between states.

During a 1967 conflict, Israel took control of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem—regions of ancient Palestine that the Palestinians desire to become a state. 

Since then, it has constructed and gradually increased the number of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Prior to its pullout in 2005, it established settlements in Gaza as well.

The UN and the vast majority of the international community consider the Palestinian territory as Israeli-occupied.

instagram,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu have thanked US lawmakers after they voted in favor of new aid packages for their countries worth billions of dollars.

“Thank you friends, thank you America!” said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a post on social media, adding that the bill demonstrates “strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization.” 

“Thank you, America!” Zelensky wrote on his Telegram on Saturday, shortly after the House of Representatives passed the long-delayed Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act by a vote of 311-112.

The bill was part of a wider $95 billion package providing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region. It provides nearly $61 billion to help Ukraine and others in the region fight Russia, while the House also passed funding worth $26.4 billion for Israel and $8.1 billion to counter China’s actions in the Indo-Pacific.

instagram,"The Biden administration, which has come under heavy fire for its unyielding pro-Israeli stand on the nine-month-old war in Gaza, is facing a rebellion within its own bureaucratic ranks—12 and counting. The 12 government officials, who recently resigned, have accused the US of providing diplomatic cover for the continuous flow of arms to Israel ensuring “our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza.”

This is not only morally reprehensible and in clear violation of international humanitarian law and US laws, but it has also put a target on America’s back,” they continue, arguing that it has put the lives of service members and diplomats at risk. Dr. Alon Ben-Meir, a retired professor of international relations, most recently at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University (NYU), and who taught courses on international negotiation and Middle Eastern studies, told IPS: “I share the overall view of the 12 US government officials who have resigned in protest against the Biden administration’s policy in connection with the Israel-Hamas war”.

They wrote in their joint statement, titled Service in Dissent, that “America’s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza. This is not only morally reprehensible and in clear violation of international humanitarian law and US laws, but it has also put a target on America’s back.”

Thousands of migrants are now concentrated in southern Tunisian towns such as Amra and Jbeniana, many of them fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East in the hope of a better life in Europe.

ऐसे में पूरी दुनिया हैरान है कि आखिर युद्ध के मैदान में चल क्या रहा है! दरअसल, यह युद्ध जितना मैदान में लड़ा जा रहा है, उससे कहीं ज्यादा भीषण तरीके से इन्फॉर्मेशन स्पेस में लड़ा जा रहा है, यानी इंफो वॉरफेयर, जिसके चलते यह पता करना बेहद मुश्किल हो रहा है कि युद्ध में आखिर चल क्या रहा है। युद्ध को कवर करनेवाले पत्रकार भी इस खेल को नहीं समझ पा रहे हैं।

किसी भी युद्ध को कवर करने के लिए किसी पत्रकार को सेनाओं के साथ एंबेडेड होने की क्या मजबूरी होती है, उस पर भी कुछ सामग्री इस पुस्तक में है। क्योंकि बिना एंबेडेड जर्नलिज्म के युद्ध की कवरेज करना मुश्किल होता है। लेकिन उस तरह की पत्रकारिता की क्या कमियाँ हो सकती हैं और उसे कैसे सुधारा जा सकता है, उसके बारे में थोड़ा बताने और समझाने का प्रयास इस पुस्तक के माध्यम से किया गया है।

instagram,"Digital settler colonialism, defined most recently in Kawsar Ali’s publication on the integration between technology, race, and cyberspace, is the practice of using the internet to perpetuate the legacy of settler states.

Indeed, studies hinting at digital settler colonialism date back to 1972 when Herbert I. Schiller explored the impact of digital communication tools enhancing Western cultural domination but received little press attention. Attempts to explain relationships between digital platforms and the politics of war have appeared more frequently following Wendy K. Chun’s characterization of race and technology as not cohabitating factors, but the former as a technique of the latter – for the one that uses, it and the one used by it. 

In today’s context, Big Tech’s maintenance of the content of Israel’s latest genocide of Palestinians in Gaza via social media and beyond catches the convergence of Big Tech digital colonialism and Israeli settler colonialism, translating previous suspicions to reality.

The Houthis enforced the embargo in solidarity with Palestinians fighting the occupying state's barbaric attack in the Gaza Strip.

A member of the Hezbollah Al-Nujaba section of the resistance group informed the newspaper that Saudi Arabia has given its territory to send materials to Israel and break the Houthis' blockade. According to Firas Al-Yasser, the Islamic Resistance factions have switched their focus to the kingdom rather than its help to Israel.

The Knesset resolution stated that the Palestinian state would remain a threat to the existence of Israel and to Israeli citizens.

Speaking at a public debate with former US Ambassador Daniel Speckhard at the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated that after three years of tumultuous bilateral relations, things have improved between the two NATO members.

Mitsotakis stated that, while some fundamental Turkish attitudes on the Eastern Mediterranean remain unaltered despite improved relations, ""We are cooperating better in addressing irregular migration."" We achieved an arrangement that allows Turkish nationals to travel to (certain) Aegean islands via a visa-easing program. These are some of the beneficial steps.

instagram,"Colum McCann begleitet mich schon seit „Der Tänzer“. Der Journalist schreibt unglaublich dicht erzählte, aufwendig recherchierte Romane über ganz unterschiedliche Themen, die mich bisher (bis auf „Transatlantik“) immer tief beeindruckt haben. Sie brachten mir einen russischen Balletttänzer, die Erbauer der New Yorker U-Bahn, eine dichtende Roma und das New York der 1970er Jahre nahe. In seinem neusten Werk, das schon 2020 erschien, schreibt der Ire nun über den israelisch-palästinensischen Konflikt. Doch ein bisschen weit hergeholt? Ich finde nicht. Gerade aus der Distanz heraus gelingt es ihm, dieses Thema in unzähligen Facetten zu beleuchten, die einen die aktuellen Ereignisse so viel besser verstehen lassen. Neutral ist McCann dabei nicht. Durch die Stimmen seiner Protagonisten, dem Palästinenser Bassam und dem Israeli Rami, übermittelt er eine klare Botschaft: Sie werben für eine friedliche Lösung und das Ende der Besatzung.
 
Die beiden Protagonisten sind reale Personen. Beide verloren ein Kind im Konflikt und schworen daraufhin nicht etwa blutige Rache, sondern schlossen sich der Organisation „Parents Circle“ an, um die Geschichte ihrer Töchter publik zu machen, gegenseitiges Verständnis zwischen Juden und Arabern zu vermitteln und für das Ende der Gewalt einzutreten. Erzählt wird diese Geschichte in vielen kurzen Informationsbruchstücken. Der Name des Romans ist dabei Programm: „Apeirogon“ bezeichnet eine geometrische Figur mit einer nahezu unendlichen Menge Seiten. Nicht bei jedem dieser Informationshäppchen wird der Zusammenhang direkt deutlich. Da ist viel von verschiedenen Vögelarten die Rede, private Geschichten von Politikern oder historischen Persönlichkeiten kommen zur Sprache, mathematische Lehren werden wiedergegeben. Sogar den Tunnelbauern aus „Der Himmel unter der Stadt“ und dem Motiv des Seiltänzers aus „Die große Welt“ begegnen wir wieder.

instagram,"One of Trump’s favourite claims is that the mainstream media is Fake News because it is biased against him in particular. But this is largely a myth. The media has a bias towards the establishment, American imperialism, and Z*onism. Not a “left-wing bias” as conservatives often claim. 

Any bias against Trump shown by the media is coincidental by nature. They are shills for career politicians and since Trump entered politics much later than most politicians did, he isn’t as respected in the media. It has nothing to with leftism or with the media going “woke.” 

This is clearly shown when the media overlooks yet another massacre in Gaza (which is part of a gen0cide the media consistently denies) to focus on Trump.

instagram,"United Nations human rights experts have accused Israel of carrying out a “targeted starvation campaign” that has resulted in the deaths of children in Gaza.

“Israel’s intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza,” 10 independent UN experts said in a statement on Tuesday.

Israel’s diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva dismissed the statement and accused the experts of “spreading misinformation” and “supporting Hamas propaganda”.

Gaza health authorities have said at least 33 children have died of malnutrition, mostly in northern Gaza, which had until recently faced the brunt of the Israeli military campaign launched in October.

In recent months, Israel’s ground invasion has also spread to southern Gaza, reducing aid flows into the enclave amid restrictions by Israel, which has accused UN agencies of failing to distribute supplies efficiently.

The deaths of a baby “barely six months old”, a nine-year-old boy and a thirteen-year-old boy since May 30 showed “there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza,” the experts said.

instagram,"Israeli and US officials were hopeful last week about a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. The Palestinian militant group indicated willingness to compromise on a key issue. However, achieving an agreement remains uncertain despite these positive developments.There is optimism that a deal could be reached, especially after a senior Hamas official told CNN that the group is open to reconsidering its demand that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before agreeing to a temporary truce. This agreement would also begin the process of releasing hostages still held in Gaza.Last week, a US official mentioned to CNN that a basic agreement framework is in place, and talks resumed on Friday in Doha. Egypt’s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News channel reported that discussions will continue in Cairo this week.However, a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office on Sunday suggested doubts about the deal's progress. The statement outlined several principles Israel is not willing to compromise on, including the continuation of military operations in Gaza until all war objectives are met.

instagram,"We could have been friends: My father and I” by Raja Shehadeh is a captivating memoir that deeply resonated with me, particularly against the backdrop of current events in Gaza. Shehadeh intricately weaves together the lives of himself and his father, Aziz, offering not just a tribute to their paternal bond but also a profound exploration of the unspoken side of Palestinian history. This memoir sheds light on both personal and legal perspectives, such as the case efforts to reclaim Palestinian frozen money since 1948. It also addresses geopolitical complexities, including the actions of some Arab governments and the enduring repercussions of the Nakba. While the book is a testament of the nagging regret of his failure to understand his father, it also serves as a powerful examination of familial ties, political turmoil, and an unwavering quest for justice. Raja Shehadeh’s narrative is deeply humane and skillfully captures the resilience and struggles of the Palestinian people, making it a compelling read that leaves a lasting impression.",-1.0,8.0,,israelpalestineconflict,Savitha Vaidyanathan,2024-07-15T14:08:48.000Z

The Islamic Dawa Party, a Shia political party, had a strong presence in the town. #SaddamHussein, was a Sunni Arab had become the President of Iraq in 1979 and had ordered the invasion of #Iran, a predominantly Shia country, in Sept 1980. #OTD, Hussein visited Dujail to praise men from the village who were conscripted into the #IranIraqWar. During his motorcade’s exit from the town, a dozen Shia IDP members opened fire from the cover of the date palm orchards lining both sides of the road. Two of Hussein’s bodyguards were killed but the President was uninjured. Hussein ordered his special security and military forces to round up all suspected members of the IDP along with their families. The round-up resulted in 393 men and 394 women and children from Dujail and nearby Balad being detained. Over 40 of the detainees were killed during interrogation while another 140+ were sentenced and executed. Over 400 more were sent into exile. Following Hussein’s capture and conviction after the #IraqWar (2003-11), the dictator was hanged for crimes against humanity partially in connection with the #DujailMassacre.

instagram,"Five members of Nahdliyin met with President Isaac Herzog in Israel. This meeting has caused significant repercussions because the Executive Board of Nahdlatul Ulama (PBNU) never gave permission for it.

PBNU Chairman Savic Ali expressed regret over the five Nahdliyin meeting with Israel's President Isaac Herzog. Savic stated that the visit by the five Nahdliyin was not in the name of NU.
""The visit was likely made in a personal capacity. We do not know their purpose or who sponsored them. This is a regrettable action,"" said Savic, as quoted by the official NU website, Monday (15/7/2024).

Savic assessed that the visit by the five Nahdliyin resulted from a lack of understanding of geopolitics and NU's organizational policies, as well as the sentiments of all NU members. He said PBNU does not yet know who sponsored the departure of the five Nahdliyin to Israel.
He added that although the visit was personal, the five are known as NU members and activists. This, according to Savic, worsens NU's image in the public eye. Especially since PBNU and Nahdliyin's stance is in support of Palestine and condemns Israel's military aggression.

""Israel still does not recognize Palestine and continues its military aggression, causing thousands of casualties. Israel continues to drop bombs and bullets on Palestinians. The number of victims is enormous, mostly civilians,"" he said.
PBNU Secretary General Saifullah Yusuf stated that they would summon the five Nahdliyin who met with Israel's President Isaac Herzog. PBNU will clarify the background of the departure of these five young figures.

""These five individuals did not receive a mandate from PBNU, nor did they ever seek permission from PBNU,"" he said.

My analysis for Voice of America Indonesian broadcast on the war in Gaza and its continued enablement in the near-unbridled US military aid to Israel as IDF operations continue to massacre Palestinian civilians en masse. 

There is simply no other way to color this conflict and the US role in it: Either we care about safeguarding civilians in war and upholding strict standards of precision warfare and the humane treatment of civilian populations—or we do not. 

“What the IDF are doing is knowingly striking these targets with high numbers of civilians present. Their views on proportionality are starkly different from how the US and other allies interpret proportionality.”

According to the AFP, Israeli jets fired four missiles against the Ibn Uthman Mosque in the Shuja'iyya district of central Gaza City, a week after launching a brutal onslaught in the area.

According to experts, the mosque is the second largest archaeological mosque in the Gaza Strip after the Great Al-Omari Mosque, located in the Al-Daraj district in the city's center, and serves as testimony of Gaza City's ancient history.

instagram,"A phrase from Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight might be applied to many political careers: ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" It is a warning, a shot across the bow, that perfectly captures how, in the end, hubris and complacency are intrinsic aspects of the human condition. A person in power for an extended period of time can become the polar opposite of what they previously represented. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of Turkey, is a prime example of this. The recent news that he is working to normalize diplomatic relations with Bashar Assad's Syria is very disturbing.

The fact is, she’s been elected to represent the Australian people under the auspices of the labour ticket. Yet she’s thrown it back in the faces of both groups by her actions…all the while galavanting her family around courtesy of the Aussie tax payer, in a cost of living crisis. [read the story in news.com.au] 

While the lefties will hail her a saint and martyr, she is anything but. That said, we do have to commend her for having the courage of her convictions...even if they are distorted. There are many on both sides of the isle that have less of a spine than Fatima Payman.

Organ trafficking remains a pressing global issue, with ongoing allegations against Israel regarding the harvesting of organs from deceased Palestinians. The Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor recently accused Israeli forces of stealing organs from Palestinian bodies in Gaza, including livers, kidneys, hearts, cochleas, and corneas. Medical professionals in Gaza have corroborated these claims, despite denials from Israeli authorities.

Recent reports continue to underscore historical accusations against Israel for organ theft. Investigations have documented instances of organ harvesting from Palestinian corpses for medical research and transplants. In 2014, an Israeli television investigation revealed the extraction of skin from deceased Palestinians and African workers for medical purposes. These consistent reports indicate Israel's involvement in the global black market for human organs.

The involvement of Israeli military authorities in organ trafficking has been suggested by investigations, which indicate the participation of medical professionals and students in these activities. Despite persistent allegations and evidence, Israel denies any wrongdoing.

These allegations not only raise serious human rights concerns but also highlight broader issues regarding accountability and the rule of law. The need for international scrutiny and robust legal frameworks is evident to address these allegations impartially and ensure justice.

These ongoing challenges underscore the importance of comprehensive investigations and international cooperation to uphold human rights and the rule of law effectively.

instagram,"On Thursday last week, the US House of Representatives passed an amendment to restrict the US State Department from utilizing Gaza’s Health Ministry statistics to mention the mortality counts for Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Israel frequently claims that it has no information on the Palestinian civilians killed or injured by its bombs, preferring to focus the narrative on allegedly eradicating Hamas. The latest pro-Israel gesture by Congress, therefore, means that the State Department is now entirely implicated in trying to erase the truth of genocide from global consciousness. For Palestinians, the act is another step toward their elimination and eradication from both memory and statistics.

Court documents made public on Thursday showed that the UK, an ICC member state, filed a request with the Court earlier this month to provide written observations on whether ""the Court can exercise jurisdiction over Israeli nationals, in circumstances where Palestine cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over Israeli nationals (under) the Oslo Accords"".

instagram,"☀️Kiddom Summer Camp and the Rotaract Club of Karachi Kolach joined hands to support the *""Stand with Gaza""* initiative, fostering solidarity and awareness among children. 

⛺The camp featured an engaging tableau where teachers vividly illustrated the complexities of the Israel-Palestine, Iran, and Turkey situation. This creative presentation helped the young participants grasp the historical and political context. 

🎨To further immerse the children in the cause, their faces were painted with the Palestinian flag, symbolizing unity and support.

🌎An informative awareness session educated the children on identifying and avoiding products from Israel, highlighting alternatives they could choose instead. 

🇵🇸A room was transformed to represent Gaza, providing a small yet impactful glimpse into the lives of those affected. This immersive experience helped the children understand the reality of the situation.

🎨Lastly, a hand-printing activity on a large Palestinian flag allowed the kids to leave their mark, symbolizing their support and hope for peace. 

😊 Through these activities, the camp successfully raised awareness and fostered empathy among the young participants.

“In particular, there will need to be an effective Palestinian government that accepts Israel’s right to exist and categorically renounces terrorism,” he said. “Both sides have legitimate rights, and both peoples have a right to live in peace and dignity within secure borders.”

Dr Balakrishnan urged both sides to seize the moment to take steps towards a long-lasting peace and put an end to the suffering that has “gone on for too long”.

Lieberman also called Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's handling of the conflict a ""failure,"" noting that he is directly responsible after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He went on to say that without a clear plan for the battle, Israeli soldiers and officers in Rafah are frustrated, and the government is unable to make a choice or win victory in the south or north.

Israel's Walla website stated earlier this week that the Israeli occupation army is experiencing a shortage of soldiers and is attempting to construct a new division that will be established to handle a variety of tasks.

Cross-border tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have risen in recent weeks, fueling fears of a full-scale conflict. Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced from both sides of the Lebanon-Israel border as a result of shelling.

In a speech to his AK Party MPs in parliament, Erdogan stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intended to escalate the Gaza conflict throughout the region.

According to an update from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the areas are located in Khartoum, the Darfur and Kordofan regions, and El Gezira state.

As previously reported by Reuters, some 755,000 people in Sudan are experiencing ""catastrophe,"" the most severe form of intense starvation.

instagram,"The ISRAELI 🇮🇱 Government has asked Catholic and Orthodox churches to pay property tax or face legal action.

Israel' targeting Christian presence in Jerusalem: Church heads!

In this time, when the whole world, and the Christian world in particular, are constantly following the events in Israel, we find ourselves, once again, dealing with an attempt by authorities to drive the Christian presence out of the Holy Land,"" the heads of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches wrote in a letter to Israeli occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

This comes as the heads of the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Armenian Orthodox denominations have accused the Israeli occupation of a ""coordinated attack"" on the Christian presence in Jerusalem due to the decision, by several municipalities, such as Tel Aviv, Ramla, al-Nassira, and Jerusalem, to tax church properties and threatening legal action following failure to do so.

“We believe these efforts represent a coordinated attack on the Christian presence in the Holy Land,” the church leaders wrote.

Church leaders contend that the policy change, which involves taxing their properties, breaks with the longstanding tradition of exemption, an action that will impact the status quo. They further argued that even commercial properties owned by the church should not be taxed since the proceeds support collective services such as schools, hospitals, and care facilities for the elderly and disabled.

In their joint statement, on Sunday, expressing their concern over Jerusalem Municipality's decision to pursue legal action against the churches, the heads of the church said: ""We declare that such a measure both undermines the sacred character of Jerusalem and jeopardizes the Church’s ability to conduct its ministry in this land on behalf of its communities and the worldwide church.""

The conflict has historical roots. In 2018, when the Israeli-appointed Municipality of occupied Jerusalerevealed its intention to levy property taxes amounting to $174.5 million on church properties not designated for worship, it provoked a significant backlash from the churches.

The Democratic base has gone quiet, and it's doubtful they'll be energized to vote. There's talk of replacing Biden with Michelle Obama, who could energize Democrats and beat Trump. But does Michelle want to run? Her safer bet might be to let Trump win and run in 2028, allowing her the chance for two terms.

It's disheartening to see the world's most powerful nation represented by candidates focused on personal attacks on who slept with whom or who is the biggest liar,rather than addressing crucial issues like the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and the China-Taiwan tension. We need better leadership during these dangerous times. God really need to step up and bless America.

instagram,"About 50 Palestinian prisoners arrested during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine were released on Monday, including the director of Gaza's largest hospital, Israeli sources confirmed.

An Israeli security official, speaking anonymously to Xinhua, stated that the prisoners were released from various Israeli facilities, including the military detention camp of Sde Teiman in the south, where many Palestinians arrested during the ongoing conflict were held.

The official noted that the release was part of an effort to reduce the number of detainees in Sde Teiman, which is running out of space.

Mohammed Abu Selmia, head of the Al Shifa Hospital, was among those released on Monday. He was detained by Israeli forces in November 2023 while traveling south from Gaza City following an Israeli military raid on the hospital.

instagram,"Who is the occupier? 
We asked Google.

When examining the history of the land of Israel, it’s essential to look at the timeline of significant historical and religious landmarks.

The First Temple, also known as Solomon’s Temple, was built around 1000 BCE in ancient Jerusalem. 
This temple served as the central place of worship for the Israelites and housed the Ark of the Covenant. 
Its construction marks a significant chapter in the history of the Jewish people, establishing their deep-rooted presence in this land over 2,900 years ago.

In contrast, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, an important Islamic landmark, was constructed much later, in 705 CE.

These dates highlight a substantial historical context. 
The Jewish connection to the land of Israel dates back nearly 3,000 years, long before the advent of Islam. 
This deep historical bond underscores the ancient and enduring connection of the Jewish people to this land.

On May 20, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip.

“Netanyahu convened a high-stakes discussion on Tuesday evening about the looming possibility that the ICC might heed the request of its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, and soon issue arrest warrants against him and Gallant,” Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said.

The meeting was attended by Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara.

Rođen 1957. u Jerusalimu, pohađao je Akademiju umjetnosti Bezalel. 

Kasnije je tamo postao profesor i postigao je mnoga priznanja kao što su Velika nagrada Korejskog bijenala plakata 2002., Zlatna medalja Promak 1998. u Kanadi, Zlatna medalja bijenala postera u Meksiku 2002. i još mnogo toga. 
Njegovi posteri podižu svijest o mnogim temama, od njegovog postera o AIDS-u do njegovih izraelsko-palestinskih postera mira.

""Ein Sprecher der Hamas in Teheran hat gerade in der ARD Folgendes verkündet: Die Islamische Republik und die Hamas hätten ihre Partnerschaft vertieft ...

In solchen Momenten muss ich an die Nachricht einer Frau denken, die mich während der Proteste in Iran über Instagram erreicht hat. Was wäre, schrieb die iranische Frau, wenn es die Islamische Republik nicht mehr gäbe? Was, wenn wir es schaffen, das Regime zu stürzen? Die Antworten auf ihre Fragen zielen mitten ins Heute.

• Dann würden wir in einem Land leben, das befreundet wäre mit Israel.

• Dann bräuchte Israel weniger Waffen und Saudi-Arabien auch.

• Es gäbe keinen Krieg im Jemen. Irak könnte seine eigene Politik bestimmen.

• Die Hisbollah und die Hamas hätten keinen Finanzierer mehr.

• Russland würde keine Drohnen und Mittelstreckenraketen mehr geliefert bekommen, die sie im Krieg gegen die Ukraine einsetzen.

• Putin hätte keinen mächtigen Verbündeten mehr in der Region.

• Assad hätte einen Unterstützer weniger.
Die Gefängnisse, in denen politische Gefangenen sitzen, wären leer.

• Man müsste sich nicht mehr fürchten vor einer Atombombe in den Händen der Mullahs.

• Es gäbe einen neuen Markt, der offen wäre für einen enormen Nachholbedarf an Investitionen. Allein für Deutschland 20 Milliarden Investitionen - pro Jahr.

• Und vielleicht wäre eine Frau Präsidentin, die in einem ersten Amtsakt nach Yad Vashem ginge.

instagram,"O ministro das Relações Exteriores de Israel, Israel Katz, ameaçou o movimento Hezbollah com uma “guerra total” que levaria o grupo terrorista islâmico xiita à destruição. O Hezbollah tem raízes no Líbano e é fortemente apoiado pelo Irã, ditadura islâmica localizada no Golfo Pérsico.

Ao mesmo tempo em que Israel ataca a Faixa de Gaza para derrotar os terroristas palestinos do Hamas, as tensões têm aumentado na fronteira com o Líbano, que é a sede do Hezbollah, com o fogo cruzado entre o grupo e forças israelenses nas últimas semanas.

Katz deu essas declarações depois que o Hezbollah divulgou imagens que, segundo o grupo terrorista garantiu, foram feitas por um drone em Haifa, cidade portuária no norte de Israel.

“Estamos muito próximos do momento em que decidiremos mudar as regras do jogo contra o Hezbollah e o Líbano. Em uma guerra total, o Hezbollah será destruído e o Líbano será duramente atingido”, disse Katz, de acordo com um comunicado de seu gabinete divulgado na rede X.

De acordo com o ministro israelense, o líder do Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, “se vangloria hoje [terça-feira] de ter fotografado os portos de Haifa, operados por grandes empresas internacionais chinesas e indianas, e de ameaçar danificá-los”.

instagram,"It‘s been eight months since I last posted on this subject, but on the flip side, it gave me time to better understand the situation on the ground. 

Whether we want to admit it or not, Hamas is currently the best hope for Palestinians, which is why both pro-Palestine activists and the UN refuse to condemn Hamas as a whole. We should certainly be critical of Hamas and condemn the war crimes committed on Oct 7th. However, to condemn Hamas as a whole right now would be like condemning the Red Army during WWII: https://worldwithoutgenocide.org/genocides-and-conflicts/holocaust-of-jews/nazi-extermination-of-russian-pows

A large number of Hamas fighters are orphans who’ve witnessed Israel kill their family members. One could only imagine the rage they must’ve felt when they saw thousands of people casually dancing at a music festival just 3km away from an open air concentration camp, the same one they just flew out of. Rage and revenge are not excuses for war crimes, but it does put things into perspective.

instagram,"Satan and Lucifer: The Duality of Light and Shadow

In the shadow of conflicts where hatred is woven, Satan, the horned god, amuses and provokes us, His malevolent grin poisons the hearts, de
The armies tear each other apart under his dark lightning.

On the table of destiny, the figurines fall, Chaos reigns supreme, death in numbers, Souls in suffering, trapped in war, Under the cruel gaze of Satan, the sinister father.

But beyond the darkness, a light rises, Lucifer, the bringer of flame, with a noble dream, On the same table, he watches tenderly, Yesterday's enemies reconcile, in joy.

His face illuminated with divine gentleness, He lights the paths to finer ways, Hearts untangle, hands finally clasp, Peace settles, under his serene gaze.

Thus goes the duality of this fragile world, Between shadow and light, an eternal exile, Satan and Lucifer, two sides of the same mirror, Reveal our choices, our essence, our hope.

In the tumult of conflicts, let us seek clarity, For even in the heart of shadows, hope can shine, May Lucifer's light guide our steps, And may Satan be but an echo of the past, already.

Khamenei grants pardons on a variety of occasions, including the anniversary of the 1979 revolution and religious holidays.

instagram,"“When someone shows you who they are,” Maya Angelou said, “believe them the first time.” That should apply to foreign-policy elites who show you who they are, time after time. Officials running the Pentagon and State Department have been in overdrive for more than 250 days in support of Israel’s ongoing slaughter of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Supposedly dedicated to defense and diplomacy, those officials have worked to implement and disguise Washington’s war policies, which have taken more lives than any other government in this century.

Among the weapons of war, cluster munitions are especially horrific. That’s why 67 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted last week to prevent the U.S. government from continuing to send those weapons to armies overseas. But more than twice as many House members voted the other way. They defeated a Pentagon funding amendment that would have prohibited the transfer of cluster munitions to other countries. The lawmakers ensured that the U.S. can keep supplying those weapons to the military forces of Ukraine and Israel.

As of now, 124 nations have signed onto a treaty banning cluster munitions, which often wreck the bodies of civilians. The “bomblets” from cluster munitions “are particularly attractive to children because they resemble a bell with a loop of ribbon at the end,” the Just Security organization explains.

instagram,"Geopolitics Review - 24th June 2024

Since the start of this conflict on October 7th, we’ve seen 38,151 Palestinians killed, 86,032 injured, and 1,139 Israelis killed. Gazan infrastructure has been destroyed, and aid isn’t being allowed in.

The Israeli operation made moves into Rafah in May, casting aside the international outcry not to invade the region. Israel has its goals of removing Hamas from power in the Gaza Strip and removing any security threats, and they’re going to continue on this path until they’ve achieved this.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also incentivised individually. His rule as Prime Minister is part of a far-right coalition that wants to continue the war. One party in the coalition threatened to dissolve the government if Netanyahu was to agree to Biden’s recent peace proposal. It’s the far-right that typically most strongly opposes a Palestinian state and supports the expansion of settlements in the West Bank. To uphold his political career, Netanyahu has swayed further right. He also is facing corruption charges so prolonging the war could prolong the ongoing trial.

The war as it continues is raising tensions in the North between Israel and Hezbollah, and the international community continues to support the establishment of a Palestinian state, with 145 or 193 UN members supporting it. Even tensions are rising between Biden and Netanyahu. This week I’ll provide updates on the conflict and the rising tensions with many actors. Let’s get started with today’s piece.

instagram,"In 1915, the First World War began, during which the British and the French divided the Middle East between themselves. The British took control of Palestine from 1918 to 1948.

During Hitler’s rule, millions of Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, leading to a flow of Jewish refugees to Palestine. In 1948, the British withdrew, and the UN proposed a division between a Jewish and an Arab state. The Jews accepted and formed the state of Israel, triggering a war with the surrounding Arab countries.

After Israel’s victory in the war in 1949, they expanded their territory, while the Gaza Strip became part of Egypt and the West Bank part of Jordan. This left the Palestinians as refugees without their own land, and further conflicts, including the Six-Day War in 1967, led to Israel’s occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.

In 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and the PLO (The Palestine Liberation Organization), marking a step towards a Palestinian government. Unfortunately, illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and extremism on both sides prevented a lasting peace.

After the assassination of Israel’s Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the establishment of the militant group Hamas in Gaza, the situation became more tense. Hamas’ victory in the Palestinian elections in 2006 led to internal conflicts between Hamas and Fatah, with Gaza under their control, while the West Bank is governed by the PLO. Israel continued with illegal occupation and settlements in Palestine.

The current conflict escalated after October 7, 2023, contributing to a worsening of the situation in the region.

instagram,"In 1947, the UN’s Partition Plan sparked the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, leading to decades of violence and suffering, particularly for children. Both sides often instill conflict-driven narratives instead of prioritizing education, creating a cycle of militarization and trauma. Tragically, many young people are prepared for violence rather than peace. To pave the way for a hopeful future, we must address these influences and advocate for a world where children can thrive free from the horrors of war. Every child deserves a chance to grow up in peace!

The case, filed in federal court in New York, demands at least $4 billion in damages for orchestrating extrajudicial killings, hostage takings, and other atrocities for which the defendants supplied material support and resources.

instagram,"📌 Oxfam has reported that Israel has reduced the amount of water available to Gazans by 94% since the onset of the conflict on October 7, 2023. The organization's analysis highlights that the water supply has plummeted to just 4.74 liters per person per day, which is significantly below the recommended minimum for emergencies and equivalent to less than a single toilet flush.

📌 The report, titled ""WATER WAR CRIMES,"" details how Israel's actions, including the cutting of external water supplies, systematic destruction of water infrastructure, and obstruction of humanitarian aid, have contributed to this crisis. Since the beginning of the conflict, Israeli military attacks have damaged or destroyed water and sanitation facilities at an alarming rate, with five sites affected every three days. 

📌 The destruction of essential infrastructure has led to a catastrophic public health situation, with over a quarter of Gaza's population suffering from preventable diseases due to the lack of clean water and sanitation.

📌 Oxfam has called for urgent international action to address the humanitarian crisis, including a ceasefire and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza to allow for the restoration of water and sanitation services. The organization emphasizes that the systematic deprivation of water constitutes a violation of international law and poses immediate and long-term threats to the health and survival of the Palestinian population in Gaza.

Berggren var under sina år i Jerusalem först rådgivare till Tony Blair och sedan stabschef inom Kvartetten! All den kunskap Johan Berggren samlat på sig om konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina har han samlat i boken Den perfekta konflikten! Berggren belyser konflikten ur alla möjliga synvinklar och perspektiv och lyfter även in omvärldens roll i fredsprocessen, vilken roll har USA, FN, Arabförbundet, EU, Sverige och många fler spelat både historiskt och i nutid? Det ska tilläggas att boken kom ut 2021, så de senaste månadernas brutala utveckling är såklart inte med och analyserad i boken! Dock anser jag boken vara väldigt läsvärd då den ger läsaren en god insikt och förståelse för en svårlöst och brutal konflikt!

instagram,"The Palestinian group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said.

Islamic Jihad said its fighters fired rockets toward several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to ""the crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian people"".

The volley of about 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed they possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it.

Residents of several neighbourhoods in eastern Khan Younis, which is in southern Gaza, said they had received audio messages from Israeli phone numbers ordering them to leave their homes.

instagram,"“Make it a post” they said! 
For those asking how should a Christian view the Israel - Palestine conflict ? 

I hope you can see what my main point is - not to do with war, but salvation. 

Yk, even I was not exactly with Israel when this all began. But God made us fast and pray for Israel as a Church. Then my eyes were opened to the scriptures and who Israel is to us, even today. 

“For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.” Romans 11:29

Am I biased towards Israel? No. But the irony is the amount of people who are biased against Israel, the victims in this war. 

Yes I am aware that the death count caused by Israel is way higher than by Palestine. You know what else is true? Who started the war. And who paid the price. Civilian Israeli hostages still haven’t been returned yet. 

The manifesto of Hamas is to finish Israel. Israel is trying to maintain its existence and spare as many civilians in offending territories as possible, and being faulted for it. 

Let atleast the adopted family of Israel (non Israeli Christians) know that without this nation, our place before God also stands shaken. Ofcourse, God will not allow that to happen. But woe to those to say they love the God of Israel but not Israel. 

Yes, love does not mean love war. I’m only talking about the basics- pray for Israel’s salvation. 
Yes, pray the same for Palestine too. 

If you happen to be a Palestinian reading this, know that I am for you. 
Just don’t expect me to be against my Israeli family. 

Please read the pics carefully before you make a judgment.

instagram,"An argument that has arisen since hamas’ brutal October 7th massacre, which saw nearly 1,200 Jews and Israelis dead, & around a further 250 taken hostage. This argument is proportionality and this argument, whether you know it or not, has deep antisemitic roots. Although it is not an argument that has been publicly used before, it is one that seems to have only been used since Israel, retaliated & went to war with hamas. Legally, Israel has a duty to protect its own people from genocide & as hamas have said, given the chance, that they will commit the atrocities of October 7th over and over again, Israel also has the right to defend herself. 

Using this against Israel, when they are fighting a war against terrorists who imbed themselves in civilian infrastructure & use their own as human shields, shifts the responsibility away from hamas and their duty as the elected governing body to protect its own. It also shifts the responsibility away from those responsible for the brutal massacre on October 7th. 

“Proportionality in war does not mean balancing number of lives lost, or buildings leveled…Proportionality is one of the core principles of the law of war—to which all recognized states have agreed. Distorting the meaning of the term undermines the values it is meant to protect.”

The IDF, have gone beyond the lengths taken during any other modern warfare, to protect Palestinian civilians & avoid casualties, which is more than can be said for hamas, who use the deaths of their civilians as a PR strategy.

But if we must talk about proportionality, perhaps we could turn our attention to the first intifada, an almost 6 year long war, which was ignited after an Israeli vehicle crashed into two vans carrying Palestinian workers, tragically killing four of them. Israel have said the crash was accidental, however Palestine saw this as revenge for the death of an Israeli a mere few days before. Whether the car crash was an accident or not, does this response seem proportionate to you?

The publication reported: ""After nine months of gruelling war, it is time to recognize the stark reality: there is no military-only solution to defeat Hamas,"" stating, ""Hamas is neither defeated nor on the verge of defeat.""

instagram,"Syrian opposition militants have apparently been recruited for combat and security missions in many African nations, in what appears to be the most recent deployment of Syrian rebels overseas at the request of Turkey.

Several Syrian rebel sources told Middle East Eye that hundreds of fighters had been deployed to the African nations of Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. While some have apparently been assigned combat tasks against Daesh in the Sahel region, others have been assigned close protection or security roles to protect Turkish industries in those countries, such as factories and mines.
